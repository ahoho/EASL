But the documents do not appear to be what the committee was hoping that Fusion GPS and its founder, Glenn Simpson, would provide. “The committee is reviewing the production received late this afternoon from Mr. Simpson, but virtually all of the documents appear to be merely news clippings rather than records of Fusion’s substantive communications,” George Hartmann, a spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee, told TheDC. The paltry document production escalates the standoff between Fusion GPS and the Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. After Simpson declined an invitation to testify before the committee last month, Grassley issued a subpoena to compel him to appear. But the subpoena was withdrawn after Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said he would voluntarily meet in a closed session with committee staff. A date for that meeting has not been set. Last month, the committee requested records from Fusion GPS, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr. and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the election. The Trump campaign gave the committee 20,000 pages of records last week while Trump Jr. and Manafort produced 250 pages and 400 pages of records, respectively. [dcquiz]<br><br>The committee is one of three congressional panels investigating Russia-related matters, including the dossier and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting held between Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney linked to Fusion GPS. In its request to Fusion, the Judiciary Committee asked for contracts that the firm signed for its work on the dossier. Fusion was initially hired to investigate Trump in Sept. 2015 by an unidentified Republican donor who opposed the real estate mogul. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor dropped the project. But Fusion soon found a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s — also still unidentified — to continue the research. Fusion hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to conduct the investigation. Fusion and Steele’s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, have worked together on various projects since 2010. The committee also asked Fusion to produce contracts and communications regarding its work against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Russian government. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the Trump Tower meeting, was involved in the same lobbying campaign. Veselnitskaya represents Denis Katsyv, the chairman of Prevezon Holdings. Fusion GPS was working for BakerHostetler, a law firm that was also representing Katsyv and Prevezon. Veselnitskaya was accompanied to the Trump Tower meeting by Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military officer who works in the same line of business as Fusion GPS, providing political and business research for shadowy clients. The Judiciary Committee is also inquiring whether Fusion and Akhmetshin have done business together in the past. The strange overlap between Fusion GPS, the dossier, and the Trump Tower meeting has piqued Grassley’s interest. He has sought to find out who exactly was paying Fusion GPS for all of its projects. Grassley is interested in the dossier because of its importance to the FBI’s collusion investigation. The bureau has reportedly used information from the dossier as part of the basis for its probe. The dossier was reportedly used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Page, an energy consultant, is named in the dossier as one of the Trump campaign’s liaisons to the Kremlin. Page has dismissed the claims. He refers to Steele’s document as “the dodgy dossier.”<br><br>Grassley has also questioned the FBI over whether it paid Steele to investigate Trump. FBI agents reportedly made an informal agreement with Steele in October to pay the former spy $50,000 to continue his investigation. That payment was reportedly never made.","Itinerary for a trip to Ukraine in August organized by the Atlantic Council think tank reveals that a staffer on Rep. Adam Schiff’s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with acting U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor, now a key witness for Democrats pursuing impeachment. Taylor has been called by House Democrats to appear next week to provide a deposition as part of the investigation being led by Schiff into President Trump’s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Taylor himself has evidenced a close relationship with the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council, writing analysis pieces published on the Council’s website and serving as a featured speaker for the organization’s events. He also served for nine years as senior advisor to the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council, which has co-hosted scores of events with the Atlantic Council. As Breitbart News reported, Thomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff’s House Intelligence Committee, took a trip to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan “Ukraine Study Trip” in which ten Congressional staffers participated. Eager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that says it “educates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.” The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program. Burisma in January 2017 signed a “cooperative agreement” with the Council to specifically sponsor the organization’s Eurasia Center, the same center that sponsored Eager’s Ukraine trip. A closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation’s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor. Spokespeople for Schiff’s office did not reply to multiple Breitbart News requests sent over the course of the last three days for comment on Eager’s meeting with Taylor. When Breitbart News first reported on Eager’s visit to Ukraine two weeks ago, Schiff’s office quickly replied to several comment requests, denying any impropriety related to Eager’s association with the Atlantic Council or the trip. The unanswered Breitbart email requests to Schiff’s office from the past three days posed the following question: While in Ukraine, did Mr. Eager speak to Mr. Taylor about the issue of reports about any representatives of President Trump looking into alleged Biden corruption in Ukraine? Eager’s visit to Ukraine sponsored by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council began 12 days after the so-called “whistleblower” officially filed his August 12 complaint. Schiff and his office have offered seemingly conflicting statements on the timeline of the California Congressman’s initial contact with the so-called “whistleblower.” Speaking on September 17, Schiff told MSNBC, “We have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.” Schiff’s spokesperson, Patrick Boland, was quoted on October 2 saying, “At no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.” Boland said Schiff’s committee received the complaint the night before it publicly released the document. On Oct 2, however, the New York Times reported that Schiff received some of the contents of the complaint through an unnamed House Intelligence Committee aide initially contacted by the so-called “whistleblower,” described as a CIA officer. The Times reported the aide “shared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff.” The referenced officer refers to the so-called “whistleblower.” The newspaper also reported: By the time the whistle-blower filed his complaint, Mr. Schiff and his staff knew at least vaguely what it contained Speaking to CBS’s Face the Nation on Sunday, Schiff conceded that he was not clear enough about his contact with the so-called “whistleblower.” “I should have been much more clear,” Schiff said. Taylor, who emerged from government retirement in June to serve as charge d’affaires in Kyiv, is being deposed by House Democrats after text messages provided to Democrats showed him expressing concern about Trump’s requests for Ukraine to investigate the Bidens over issues related to Burisma. NBC News quoted sources saying Taylor will be represented during the deposition by attorney John Bellinger, who served at the National Security Council and as the State Department’s lead lawyer under President George W. Bush’s administration. Bellinger was a prominent “Never Trump” Republican, drafting an August 2016 letter with dozens of other senior Republican national security officials warning Trump would be the “most reckless President in American history.” Taylor and Atlantic Council Taylor has authored numerous analysis pieces published by the Atlantic Council. In March, three months before he became Trump’s ambassador to Ukraine, the Atlantic Council featured an oped co-authored by Taylor in which the diplomat argued Ukraine “has further to travel toward its self-proclaimed European goal” of reformation. In 2017, Taylor wrote a piece for the Council about a Ukrainian parliament vote on health care reform. In November 2011, the Atlantic Council hosted Taylor as the featured speaker at a discussion event when he was appointed that year as Special Coordinator for Middle East Transitions at the State Department. When he deployed to Ukraine as Trump’s ambassador in June, the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), which has co-hosted events with the Atlantic Council, authored a piece in the Kyiv Post welcoming him. Taylor for the last nine years served as a senior adviser to the USUBC. On June 26, just nine days after arriving in Ukraine as ambassador, the USUBC already hosted Taylor for a roundtable discussion about his new position. Vadym Pozharskyi, adviser to the board of directors at Burisma Holdings, was also previously hosted as a USUBC featured speaker. A USUBC senior adviser is David J. Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain, who served at the McCain Institute for International Leadership as senior director for human rights and democracy. Kramer played a central role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier. In the USUBC piece welcoming Taylor to Ukraine, Kramer himself commented about Taylor’s ambassador position. Geysha Gonzalez is the sponsoring Atlantic Council officer listed on the Congressional disclosure form for Schiff staffer Eager’s trip to Ukraine. Kramer revealed in testimony that he held a meeting about the anti-Trump dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News, who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer’s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. Speaking to Breitbart News, Gonzalez confirmed that Eager started his one-year fellowship with the organization in January and that Eager is still a fellow. Burisma and Atlantic Council Besides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank. Only four months ago, the company co-hosted the Council’s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference. Burisma further co-hosted a U.S.-Ukraine Business Council event with the Council last year in Washington, DC. David Kramer of the dossier episode is a senior adviser to the Business Council. Burisma and the Atlantic Council also signed a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma’s financial support, reportedly to focus “on European and international energy security.” Burisma advertises that it committed itself to “15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.” Common funding themes Besides Burisma funding, the Atlantic Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros’s Open Society Foundations, Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., and the U.S. State Department. Google, Soros’s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund, and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called “whistleblower’s” complaint alleging Trump was “using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country” in the 2020 presidential race. The charges in the July 22 report referenced in the “whistleblower’s” document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called “whistleblower’s” own claims, as Breitbart News documented. One key section of the so-called “whistleblower’s” document claims that “multiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.” This was allegedly to follow up on Trump’s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the “cases” mentioned in that call, according to the so-called “whistleblower’s” narrative. The so-called “whistleblower’s” account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to: Write that Ukraine’s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko “also stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.” Document that Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani “had spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.” Bolster the charge that, “I also learned from a U.S. official that ‘associates’ of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.” The so-called “whistleblower” then relates in another footnote, “I do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.” The OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a “joint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.” BuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. The so-called “whistleblower’s” document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.","Flynn bombshells cast doubt on Mueller prosecutor Brandon Van Grack's compliance with court order<br><br>Explosive, newly unsealed evidence documenting the FBI's efforts to target national security adviser Michael Flynn -- including a top official's handwritten memo debating whether the FBI's ""goal"" was ""to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired"" -- calls into question whether Brandon Van Grack, a Justice Department prosecutor and former member of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Team, complied with a court order to produce favorable evidence to Flynn. Since February 2018, Van Grack has been obligated to comply with D.C. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan's standing order in the Flynn case to produce all evidence in the government’s possession “that is favorable to defendant and material either to defendant’s guilt or punishment.”<br><br>The order also requires the government to submit favorable defense evidence to the court, including possible ""impeachment evidence"" that could undermine witnesses, even if the government believes the evidence “not to be material.”<br><br>WHO IS JOE PIENTKA, MYSTERY FBI AGENT AT CENTER OF FLYNN AND CARTER PAGE CASES? ... FBI SCRUBS HIM FROM WEBSITE<br><br>Van Grack has long informed Sullivan that the government’s so-called ""Brady"" obligations, referring to prosecutors' duty to turn over exculpatory materials to defendants, have been met. In an October 2019 filing, Van Grack denied governmental misconduct and assured the court that the government “has complied, and will continue to comply, with its discovery and disclosure obligations, including those imposed pursuant to Brady and the Court’s Standing Order.”<br><br>In that same October 2019 motion, Van Grack elaborated on those claims, telling Sullivan that the government had not “affirmatively suppressed evidence” or hid Brady material. He denied that government was “aware of any information that would be favorable and material to [Flynn] at sentencing.”<br><br>Van Grack further dismissed arguments by Flynn's attorney, Sidney Powell, that “General Flynn was targeted and taken out of the Trump administration for concocted and political purposes” as “conspiracy theories.”<br><br>DOJ regulations state that prosecutors like Van Grack, ""with limited exceptions ... should be granted access [by FBI agents] to the substantive case file and any other file or document"" that they ""have reason to believe may contain discoverable information related to the matter being prosecuted."" The regulations state that prosecutors can ""personally review the file or documents or may choose to request production of potentially discoverable materials from the case agents."" What Van Grack didn’t inform the court about – and didn’t provide to Flynn – was the newly unsealed January 4, 2017 ""Closing Communication"" from the FBI Washington Field Office, which recommended the FBI close its investigation of Flynn, as its exhaustive search through government databases “did not yield any information on which to predicate further investigative efforts."" Van Grack also failed to provide evidence to Flynn’s attorneys that anti-Trump former FBI agent Peter Strzok then immediately intervened and instructed the FBI case manager handling the Flynn investigation to keep the probe open, followed by indicators that the bureau would seek to investigate Flynn for possible violations of an obscure 18th century law known as the Logan Act -- which has never been utilized in a modern prosecution. Another Strzok text mentions that the FBI’s ""7th floor"" – meaning FBI leadership – may have been involved in the decision to keep the Flynn case alive. Instead, Van Grack characterized Flynn’s alleged false statements as critical to the FBI’s “legitimate and significant investigation into whether individuals associated with the campaign of then-candidate Donald J. Trump were coordinating with the Russian government in its activities to interfere with the 2016 presidential election.”<br><br>HOROWITZ REPORT MAY INADVERTENTLY REVEAL PIENTKA'S ROLE IN PAGE, FLYNN MATTERS<br><br>He argued to Sullivan that Flynn’s “conduct and communications with Russia went to the heart of that inquiry.” And Van Grack said that Flynn’s alleged “false statements to the FBI on January 24, 2017, were absolutely material.”<br><br>But by that time, the FBI had already cleared Flynn of any improper ties, coordination, or communication with Russia. Just a day before Flynn's January 2017 White House interview, the Washington Post ran a story declaring that the FBI ""had reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit,"" citing unnamed ""U.S. officials."" Shedding light on internal FBI deliberations, notes from the then-assistant director of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division Bill Priestap -- written before the Flynn interview and after discussions with then-FBI Director James Comey and then-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, Fox News is told -- show discussions of whether their “goal” at the White House interview was “to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.”<br><br>These unsealed notes further suggest that agents planned in the alternative to get Flynn “to admit to breaking the Logan Act” when he spoke to then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential transition period. The Logan Act has never been used in a modern criminal prosecution and has a questionable constitutional status; it was enacted in 1799 in an era before telephones and was intended to prevent individuals from falsely claiming to represent the United States government abroad. ""Any criminal investigation grounded in Logan Act questions is an obvious political pretext to attack the Trump Administration,"" GOP Reps. Jim Jordan and Mike Johnson wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray on Monday, in a letter seeking in-person interviews and key documents. ""FBI attorney Lisa Page admitted to Congress the Justice Department saw the Logan Act as an 'untested' and 'very, very old' statute."" READ JORDAN AND JOHNSON'S LETTER TO THE FBI<br><br>This new evidence puts Van Grack at risk for accusations that he was misleading Sullivan as to the materiality of Flynn’s statements to FBI agents Strzok and Joe Pientka when they interviewed him in the White House on January 24, 2017. Jordan and Johnson are now specifically seeking to question Pientka, who participated in the January 2017 White House interview that led to Flynn's prosecution. Fox News has previously determined that Pientka was also intimately involved in the probe of former Trump aide Carter Page, which the DOJ has since acknowledged was riddled with fundamental errors and premised on a discredited dossier that the bureau was told could be part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Pientka was conspicuously removed from the FBI's website after Fox News contacted the FBI about his extensive role in Crossfire Hurricane Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) matters -- a change first noticed by Twitter user Techno Fog -- but sources say Pientka remains in a senior role at the agency's San Francisco field office. BOMBSHELL FBI MATERIALS REVEAL FBI DISCUSSED INTERVIEWING FLYNN TO GET HIM TO LIE, GET HIM FIRED<br><br>The FBI, speaking to Fox News last December, asserted that reporting on Pientka's identity would potentially endanger his life and would serve no legitimate journalistic purpose. Republicans have previously sought to question Pientka, however, beginning in 2018. On Monday, the FBI declined to provide any additional comment. For an individual to be prosecuted for a false statement offense under federal law, the lie must be “material.” The newly revealed materials strongly suggest the FBI wasn’t truly concerned about Flynn’s call with Kislyak during the presidential transition period. If the questioning of Flynn by Strzok and Pientka were based on a pretext, that revelation would arguably defeat any assertion that Flynn’s purported lies were material. Other reports of edited information and a secret agreement may put the issues surrounding the compliance with Sullivan’s standing order into context. FBI HAD INDICATORS THAT STEELE DOSSIER WAS RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION OPERATION<br><br>For example, the Mueller Report omitted key parts of a voicemail from Trump lawyer John Dowd to Flynn’s former lawyers discussing a joint defense agreement and the exchange of information. Additionally, the release of emails from Flynn’s former attorneys at Covington & Burling revealed the existence of “a lawyers unofficial understanding that they are unlikely to charge [Michael Flynn Jr.] in light of the [Flynn’s] Cooperation Agreement.”<br><br>Per Flynn's former lawyers, this served to ""limit"" what the government ""have to disclose"" to any defendant against whom Flynn would have to testify. That arrangement is contrary to the stated terms of the November 30, 2017 plea offer signed by Van Grack, Flynn, and his lawyers, which represents that there were no other “agreements, promises, or understandings” between the special counsel’s office and Flynn. Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor and Fox News contributor, has noted: “[F]ederal law requires all terms of a plea agreement to be disclosed to the court; prosecutors are not at liberty to obscure plea terms because they are embarrassed or tactically harmed by having agreed to them.”<br><br>The dispute over the government’s compliance with Sullivan’s standing order may bolster Flynn’s efforts to withdraw his plea or, ultimately, have the case dismissed due to government misconduct. Flynn, who has said more recently that he did not lie to the FBI, pleaded guilty in late 2017 as mounting legal fees pushed him to sell his home. Prosecutors have suggested Flynn's guilty plea allowed him to escape liability for a possible charge under the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), another little-known and once-rarely used law, for his alleged work in Turkey. Powell has stated that she expects more evidence to be produced soon, and has implied the FBI doesn't even have any proof Flynn discussed the Obama administration's sanctions with Russia's ambassador. ""No lawyer for  has heard the recording or seen the transcript [of Flynn's intercepted calls with the ambassador],"" Powell wrote on Twitter on Sunday. ""I bet $1000 there is no mention of 'sanctions.'"" During the White House interview, Flynn told the agents ""not really"" when asked if he had sought to convince Kislyak not to escalate a brewing fight with the U.S. over sanctions imposed by the Obama administration, according to a FD-302 witness report prepared by the FBI that has been disputed by Flynn's defense team. Flynn also reportedly demurred when asked if he had asked Russia to veto a U.N. Security Council resolution that condemned Israel’s settlements in the West Bank, the FBI claimed. (The Obama administration abstained in that vote.) According to the FBI's 302, Flynn issued other apparently equivocal responses to FBI agents' questions, and at various points suggested that such conversations might have happened or that he could not recall them if they did. Flynn's team has indicated he was concerned that the agents interviewing him, including Strzok and the lower-level Pientka, may have lacked the necessary security clearance to discuss sensitive foreign policy matters. Meanwhile, Van Grack’s name has been absent from the government’s latest court filings and they have yet to respond to Flynn’s latest motion to dismiss. After this article was published, the FBI provided a statement to Fox News saying that under Wray, the bureau had turned over relevant Flynn materials to the U.S. attorney probing possible FBI criminal misconduct during the Trump probe, John Durham -- but the FBI didn't say when exactly the handoff happened. “Under Director Wray’s leadership, the FBI has fully cooperated and been transparent with the review being conducted by U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen, just as it has been with U.S. Attorney John Durham and was with Inspector General Michael Horowitz,"" the statement read. The FBI continued: ""With regard to certain documents in the Michael Flynn matter from the 2016-2017 time period that are now the subject of reporting by the press, the FBI previously produced those materials to the Inspector General and U.S. Attorney Durham. The Flynn investigation was initiated and conducted during this time period, under prior FBI leadership. Since taking office, Director Wray has stressed the importance of strictly abiding by established processes, without exception. Director Wray remains firmly committed to addressing the failures under prior FBI leadership while maintaining the foundational principles of rigor, objectivity, accountability, and ownership in fulfilling the Bureau’s mission to protect the American people and defend the Constitution.”<br><br>Late Tuesday, the DOJ told Flynn's team that it was turning over even more potentially exculpatory evidence that was ""obtained and analyzed by USA EDMO [Eastern District of Missouri] in March, April and May 2020."" The precise nature of those materials was not immediately clear -- nor was it apparent why prosecutors in the Eastern District of Missouri were finally turning over the documents now. The previously released exculpatory materials discussed in this article, the DOJ has said, were obtained by EDMO in March and April.

In a Saturday evening email, an attorney representing Ford’s former classmate, Leland Ingham Keyser, stated that his client “does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection of ever being at a party or gathering where he was present, with, or without Dr. Ford.”<br><br>Keyser is now the fourth person to refute Ford’s story. Kavanaugh immediately and unequivocally denied Ford’s charge that, while intoxicated, he pushed her into a bedroom, pinned her to a bed, and attempted to rip off her clothing. Kavanaugh also implored the Judiciary Committee to hold a hearing the following day so he could clear himself. In addition to Kavanaugh, Ford claimed that three other teens were at the party that occurred circa 1982, although she is not sure of the year or location. Ford also said Mark Judge, a friend and Georgetown Preparatory classmate of Kavanaugh, was in the room with her and Kavanaugh at the time of the assault. Judge refuted Ford’s claim in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, writing “I have no memory of this alleged incident.” “Kavanaugh and I were friends in high school but I do not recall the party described” by Ford, Judge continued. Judge ended his statement by stressing that, while he did not remember the supposed party, he “never saw Brett act in the manner Dr. Ford describes.”<br><br>Ford also identified another Georgetown Prep student by his initials “PJ,” and later Patrick J. Smyth, a fellow 1983 grad of the North Bethesda, Maryland all-boys school, came forward to respond to Ford’s charge. In a statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Smyth said he wrote “to make it clear to all involved that I have no knowledge of the party in question; nor do I have any knowledge of the allegations of improper conduct she has leveled against Brett Kavanaugh.”<br><br>Smyth then added: “Personally speaking, I have known Brett Kavanaugh since high school and I know him to be a person of great integrity, a great friend, and I have never witnessed any improper conduct by Brett Kavanaugh towards women.”<br><br>While Judge and Smyth’s statements backing up Kavanaugh’s denials could be written off as friends protecting their fellow Georgetown Prep classmate, Keyser’s statement cannot. To the contrary, Keyser’s attorney admitted to CNN that his client was Ford’s life-long friend. Additionally, as the only other woman supposedly at the gathering, Keyser’s statement may hold more weight with key Republican Sen. Susan Collins, as well as the suburban moms watching what has been portrayed by the media as the latest Me Too reckoning play out just a little over a month before the midterm elections. While the Senate has now heard from all four witnesses Ford identified, it still has not heard from Ford. Through her lawyers she continues to refuse to testify, calling attempts to hear her side of the story under oath “bullying,” and drawing out negotiations. At her attorney and senators’ behest, Grassley has extended negotiations six times. Significantly, by submitting statements to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Kavanaugh, Judge, Smyth, and Keyser have all subjected themselves to legal jeopardy under federal law, which makes it a crime to make “any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation” to a Senate committee conducting an official investigation. Maybe that is why Ford’s attorneys are continuing their game of chicken with Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley and refusing to agree to terms under which Ford will testify.","President Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani outed former Obama CIA Director John Brennan as the man in charge of ‘Spygate’. Rudy claims Brennan orchestrated the ‘Spygate’ scandal and was the quarterback. She may be the link between former CIA head John Brennan and his Boss… Barack Obama. This is the greatest scandal in Western history and the six companies that control over 90% of American MSM should be co-conspirators. Massive Efforts Made to Hide Nellie Ohr’s Involvement in RUSSIAN ‘Spygate’ – She IS the Link Between Former CIA Head Brennan and His Boss – Obama <br><br>— Darrick Wilkins ( August 14, 2018<br><br>As the details behind the Spygate scandal are uncovered, the connections to former President Obama are unearthed. Trending: ICE Arrests 600+ Illegal Immigrants, Many Are Dangerous Criminals<br><br>According to Zero Hedge, the head of opposition research firm Fusion GPS admitted in December 2017 in a court filing that his firm paid the wife of a senior Justice Department official to help dig up damaging information on then-candidate Donald Trump. Glenn Simpson, co-founder of Fusion GPS, filed the signed declaration in a D.C. court this week affirming that Nellie Ohr, wife of demoted DOJ official Bruce Ohr, was contracted by Fusion through the summer and fall of 2016 “to help our company with its research and analysis of Mr. Trump,” according to the filing. The House Intelligence Committee determined that in November 2016, Simpson met with Bruce Ohr shortly after the election to discuss their findings regarding Russia and Trump. Bruce Ohr lost his senior-level position at the DOJ as associate deputy attorney general after his meetings with Simpson and British spy Christopher Steele, who assembled the Trump-Russia dossier, were discovered. And why would Fusion GPS hire Nellie Ohr? Aside from the obvious connection to her DOJ husband who was in a position to provide Fusion GPS with information on Trump gathered by US intelligence agencies, Nellie Ohr also represented the CIA’s “Open Source Works” group in a 2010 “expert working group report on international organized crime” along with Bruce Ohr and Glenn Simpson. The connections between Nellie Ohr and the ‘Spygate’ scandal were hidden at a distance for months. As noted last week at TGP, Nellie Ohr is a Communist sympathizer connected to Russia as well as a corrupt Never-Trumper. American Spectator recently posted an article on Nellie Ohr, who they call “the “dossier” spying scandal’s woman in the middle.”<br><br>To one side of Ohr, there is the Fusion GPS team, including fellow contractor Christopher Steele. To the other, there is husband Bruce Ohr, who, until his “dossier”-related demotion, was No. 4 man at the Department of Justice, and a key contact there for Steele. As central as Nellie Ohr’s placement is, her role in the creation of the “dossier” remains undefined. For example, the House Intelligence Committee memo on related matters vaguely tells us that Nellie Ohr was “employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump”; the memo adds that Bruce Ohr “later provided the FBI with all of his wife’s opposition research.” Senator Lindsey Graham more sensationally told Fox News that Nellie Ohr “did the research for Mr. Steele,” but details remain scarce. What’s more revealing about Nellie Ohr is the men in her life are protecting her involvement in the Russia scandal:<br><br>Notably, the “dossier” men in her life have tried to shield Ohr from public scrutiny, even at professional risk. Her husband, as the Daily Caller News Foundation reports, failed to disclose his wife’s employment with Fusion GPS and seek the appropriate conflict-of-interest waiver, which may have been an important factor in his demotion from associate deputy attorney general late last year. Under Senate and House questioning, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson consistently failed to disclose Nellie Ohr’s existence as one of his firm’s paid Russian experts, let alone that he hired her for the red-hot DNC/Clinton campaign Trump-Russia project. Even Christopher Steele may have tried to keep Nellie Ohr “under cover.” Steele, put forth as the “dossier” author ever since its January 2017 publication in BuzzFeed, does not appear to have let on to his many media and political contacts that he had “dossier”-assistance from at least two fellow Fusion GPS Russian experts, Nellie Ohr and Edward Baumgartner. Baumgartner, interestingly, was a Russian history major at Vassar in the 1990s when Nellie Ohr taught Russian history there. It appears that the men in Nellie’s life did all they could to prevent Nellie Ohr from being outed for being involved in the dossier because she also has links to the CIA and therefore to Brennan. If Brennan is outed as the quarterback of the dossier scandal, then by association, so is his boss, former President Obama. Now we know that communist sympathizer Nellie Ohr, and the men who surrounded her, her husband, business partners, John Brennan, and by association President Obama, were all connected. Together they attempted to prevent Candidate Trump from being elected and later to remove duly elected President Trump from office.","Two pieces of evidence that have come together prove anti-Trump dossier writer Christopher Steele was the key source for a Yahoo News story that the FBI cited to support its wiretap application. Identifying the source of that September 2016 article on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page has taken on added importance in recent weeks. First, Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a declassified memo on Feb. 2. It said the FBI relied greatly on Mr. Steele’s discredited Democrat-financed dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Mr. Page. To bolster the dossier’s charge that Mr. Page met with two Kremlin figures in Moscow, the FBI cited the Yahoo News article, which said the same thing. But the Nunes memo said the FBI, in its Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act application, wasn’t corroborating the dossier because the Page accusation in Yahoo came from the same source: Mr. Steele. “The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow,” the memo states. “This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.”<br><br>Mr. Nunes cited Mr. Steele’s testimony, through his attorneys, in a London court case in which he is being sued for libel. Then came a Democratic rebuttal from Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, a leading dossier supporter. Mr. Schiff, the House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, said Republicans failed to “cite evidence that Steele disclosed to Yahoo details included in the FISA warrant, since the British Court filings to which they refer do not address what Steele may have said to Yahoo.”<br><br>This assertion is important to Democrats. They are trying to bolster the FBI as it pursues collusion charges between the Trump campaign and Russia, and also support Mr. Steele, whose unverified accusations they have repeatedly cited. The two pieces of evidence that say Mr. Steele was in fact the source:<br><br>⦁ In the London court case, Mr. Steele acknowledged that he came to the U.S. in September 2016 at the request of Fusion GPS, which paid him with Democratic Party money. He met with a number of major news representatives, including The New York Times and The Washington Post as he tried to sell his explosive charges. Included in Mr. Steele’s list of appointments was a meeting with Mr. Isikoff. Mr. Isikoff subsequently wrote a story that matched the dossier. Both the dossier and the Yahoo story said Mr. Page met with two U.S.-sanctioned Russians, Rosneft oil chief Igor Sechin and Vladimir Putin aide Igor Diveykin. Mr. Isikoff sourced the information not to Mr. Steele but to a “Western intelligence source.”<br><br>Mr. Page, whose trip to Moscow was for a public speech at a university, has repeatedly denied under oath that he met the two men. The former Moscow resident and energy investor has decried the investigation into him, including the nearly one-year-long wiretap, which he says found no wrongdoing. ⦁ After Mr. Schiff wrote his rebuttal to the Nunes memo on Jan. 31, Mr. Isikoff, a longtime journalist in Washington with a number of scoops to his credit, posted an edition of his podcast, “Skullduggery,” on Feb. 2. Through the Nunes memo, Mr. Isikoff had just learned and said he was surprised that the FBI relied on his article before the FISA court judge. He told about being summoned by his “old friend,” Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, to a private room in a Washington hotel to meet the former spy from Britain. “Steele tells me an amazing story,” Mr. Isikoff said. “One of Donald Trump’s foreign policy advisers, Carter Page, had flown to Moscow and held private talks with close associates of Vladimir Putin about lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia. And Steele tells me something else that day that gets my attention. He has taken this information to the FBI, and the bureau is very interested. Why were they interested? What did the bureau know that would prompt them to take the next step of launching an investigation into an adviser to the Republican nominee for president?”<br><br>Mr. Isikoff subsequently wrote the article that ended up in the FBI’s FISA petition. His podcast sealed the case for Mr. Nunes. This prompts the question: Why did the FBI believe that the dossier section about Mr. Page and the Isikoff article came from collaborating sources? The answer lies in a declassified referral sent to the Justice Department from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican. The two said the evidence suggests that Mr. Steele lied to the FBI when he denied being the source. They have asked the Justice Department to investigate him. “The FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016,” the senators’ referral said. “The FISA applications make these claims specifically in the context of the September 2106 Yahoo News article. But Mr. Steele has admitted — publicly before a court of law — that he did have such contacts with the press at this time and his former business partner Mr. Simpson has confirmed it to the committee.”<br><br>The referral says that the FBI either submitted false information or “Mr. Steele made materially false statements to the FBI when he claimed he provided the dossier information only to his business partner and the FBI.”",1.22,1.1,1.5799999999999998,1.78,2.9,2.42,0.21999999999999997,0.050000000000000044,0.2899999999999999,0.06032222222222223,0.039875,0.04779499999999999

As the intelligence beat reporter for the Washington Post at the time, I watched these agencies grow in size, as dozens of new buildings appeared around the Washington region to house a ballooning workforce of over a million people with top-secret security clearances. The National Security Agency obtained permission to collect and store the private Internet correspondence and cell-phone data of millions of Americans. The F.B.I. was granted the power to obtain citizens’ banking, library, and phone records without court approval. The C.I.A. opened secret prisons abroad where they tortured terrorist suspects. Local police departments began employing military-grade weapons, armored vehicles, and cell-phone-tracking devices. All these measures, and many more, were put in place in the name of national security. And yet, last year, these vastly larger agencies failed to defend, or even warn, the American public against the most audacious Russian covert operation toward the United States since the end of the Cold War. Only after the fact, when a Russian disinformation campaign had already tainted the 2016 Presidential election, did the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, another vast post-9/11 creation, disclose the Kremlin’s interference. The unclassified January, 2017, report, made public by the O.D.N.I., included only the thinnest of evidence, leaving many people wondering if it were true. Whether the Russian campaign actually changed the outcome of the election is impossible to know, but it clearly succeeded at exacerbating political divisions in the United States and undermining the credibility of the results. Unlike 9/11, the Russian campaign did not occur without warning on a quiet fall day. Rather, it unfolded over at least six months on Americans’ social-media accounts—hardly the stuff of spy novels. Kremlin leaders had signalled their plans years in advance. The Russian playbook wasn’t a secret, either. It had been well documented by European governments, researchers, and journalists after the Kremlin’s information operations to destabilize Estonia, in 2007; Georgia, in 2008; Ukraine, in 2014; and Britain, in the leadup to the 2016 Brexit vote. Facing one of the clearest domestic threats to the U.S. in a decade, neither the F.B.I., which has the responsibility for conducting counterintelligence inside the United States, nor the O.D.N.I. warned Americans that platoons of Russian-backed automated “bots” and human trolls were working online to amplify racial divisions and anti-government conspiracy theories. The F.B.I. deputy director, Andrew McCabe, admitted in a CNBC interview on October 4th that the U.S. intelligence community “should have predicted” the attacks “with more clarity, maybe, than we did.” “When you overlay these attacks onto what we’ve known on our counterintelligence side about the Russians for many years, it completely fits into their playbook,” he went on. “This ability to insert themselves into our system, to sow discord and social and political unrest, is right up their alley, and it’s something we probably should have seen.” In a recent interview, a senior intelligence official who was given permission to speak with me, agreed. “He’s spot-on,” the official, who asked not to be named, said of McCabe. John Brennan, who served as the C.I.A. director from 2012 to 2016, has said that there was no way for U.S. intelligence officials to have seen such a Russian effort coming. “People have criticized us and the Obama Administration for not coming out more forcefully in saying it,” he said at a national-security forum in Aspen in July. “There was no playbook for this.”<br><br>Many members of the intelligence community, or I.C., as the collective agencies are known, blame President Obama for being reluctant to publicly criticize the Russian campaign during the 2016 election. But, by law, the intelligence chiefs must also keep congressional intelligence-committee members briefed on major threats to national security—yet it doesn’t look as if they gave the representatives many details either. Instead, members of Congress seemed as surprised as the rest of us when they learned about Russia’s social-media presence from recent testimony by Facebook and Twitter. Max Bergmann, who worked at the State Department until 2017, and had access to classified reports on the Russia activities, described the problem to me as “a failure of imagination. Everyone was guilty of the same sin.”<br><br>I don’t think even that sentiment captures the scope of the failure, and neither do the foreign officials and experts who watched the Russian effort unfold in the United States. A senior European diplomat, who asked not to be identified, told me recently that the two years that passed between Russia’s cyberattacks on the Ukrainian elections and the 2016 U.S. election “should have been enough to alert U.S. officials.”<br><br>Among the first to document Russia’s online disinformation tactics was Olga Yurkova, a thirty-two-year-old journalist who recently graduated from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy School of Journalism. On March 1, 2014, Yurkova watched on television and online as armed men in unmarked uniforms occupied Crimea. Russian media named them “polite people.” Yurkova and her university colleagues, steeped in previous Russian disinformation operations in the Baltics and elsewhere, knew better. “Their lies were so blatant that all Ukrainian journalists were speechless with shock,” Yurkova told me from Kiev. “As responsible journalists, we had to do something with this.” The following day, Yurkova created a Web site called StopFake.org, which is dedicated to debunking fake news and identifying Russian disinformation. The article announcing the launch of the site, and its mission, was shared thirteen thousand times on Twitter within two hours, Yurkova told me by e-mail. Readers quickly began sending in bogus stories, and soon were even trying to debunk articles themselves. Every day, StopFake’s team combed Russian- and English-language media for suspicious content. They checked the veracity of sources cited, the accuracy of translations, the validity of numbers and statistics, and the authenticity of photos and videos. Sometimes, they made phone calls to people quoted in a story, or cross-checked facts with laws and regulations. It often took weeks to refute false articles with convincing evidence. “We have been working for three years to inform very diverse people about why they should consider this problem, how they can reduce the impact of propaganda, and what are the possible ways of countering propaganda as a phenomenon,” Yurkova said. Although StopFake now publishes in eleven languages and has thirty employees, the organization still operates on a shoestring budget: two hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars in 2016, compared to an over-all U.S. intelligence budget of seventy billion dollars. StopFake doesn’t have an office, and, to save money, all of its workers use their personal computers and communicate via Facebook. Another research center whose work is public is the Strategic Communications Centre of Excellence, a NATO-affiliated organization housed in a boxy white building, which I visited last spring in Riga, Latvia. The center’s 2014 report on Russia’s campaign against Ukraine identified the same themes that the Kremlin would use against the United States two years later. “Russia media has systematically cultivated a feeling of fear and anxiety,” the report found. The Presidential Administration, a Kremlin office under the direct authority of Vladimir Putin, “controls a large number of bloggers and trolls in the social media to spread information supporting Russia’s narrative and to silence opponents.” The report said that the bloggers use false personas and identities to flood Facebook and Twitter discussions. Another analyst who publicly identified Russian disinformation tactics more than two years ago is the former journalist Ben Nimmo, now an Edinburgh-based propaganda expert and senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab. Nimmo first noticed Kremlin-linked social media interfering in Western democratic processes during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, and he says that they remain active in the U.S. today. “The structures that are in place are still operating,” Nimmo said. The hundreds of fake accounts that Facebook and Twitter recently identified as Russian-created, he warned, “are like cannon fodder. The Russians use them and just throw them away and create new ones.” Yet the intelligence community remains silent, as if the Russians had gone away. I found at least a dozen other institutes that appeared to be producing groundbreaking work. Mark Laity, the director of strategic communications at NATO military headquarters, lauded the work of research groups. “They’ve very often done far better than officialdom,” he told me. “They’re producing product that is superb.”<br><br>None of the work of these non-government researchers is conducted using surveillance systems, supercomputers, or subpoena power. Nothing the public researchers do is classified. And that is precisely the problem. Government analysts have always viewed open-source information, or OSINT, as it is called in the intelligence world, as a poor substitute for classified information. Intelligence officials often dismiss the importance of public pronouncements by foreign leaders, actions recorded by journalists, data collected by university professors, and discussions at open conferences. It is a decades-old problem. In 2002, the practice helped blind U.S. intelligence officials to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s evidence that Iraq did not actually possess weapons of mass destruction. In 2010, it blinded them again to the Arab Spring revolutions brewing across the Middle East. Devaluing OSINT has become a more significant problem as Russia and China use social media as an arena to wage disinformation operations. Unless F.B.I. agents and American intelligence officers get over this bias, they will continue asking for special powers to snoop on Internet users in ways that should not be allowed. If they are denied their surveillance requests, they will likely throw up their hands and say that they then can’t help fix the problem. (The F.B.I. declined to comment for this article.) Russian disinformation operations in the United States continue unabated. Leaving a recent closed-door hearing on the Russian campaign, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, told reporters, “You can’t walk away from this and believe that Russia’s not currently active.”<br><br>The senior intelligence official I interviewed expressed the same concern. “I don’t think we’ve seen a change at all in Russian activity,” she told me. “They are still trying to use race, religion, Democrats, Republicans, E.U., NATO issues as a division. They are still on social media in every way. There’s no change.” The official expressed worry because there has been no intense public debate in the United States, as there has been in the Baltics and Ukraine, about how to respond to Russian disinformation. “I don’t think we’ve been through the same national conversation as Ukraine and other countries to say we will use everything we can to defend against it,” she said. To see the ongoing Russia disinformation campaign for myself, one day in late September, I went to the Alliance for Securing Democracy’s new public dashboard of trending stories on six hundred Kremlin-oriented or -influenced Twitter accounts. That day, they included claims that the United States is helping ISIS in Syria, conspiracies about the Las Vegas mass shooting, and an attack on the actor Morgan Freeman for launching the Committee to Investigate Russia. The Freeman post—with the headline “Morgan Freeman Psy-Op Proves How Desperate the Deep State Has Become,”—was the most popular.","Few things better expose the fanaticism of the Trump Derangement Syndrome crowd than a porn king offering $10 million for the goods on President Donald Trump.

Dir. McCabe used official FBI email to promote wife’s candidacy: ‘Check her out<br><br>on Facebook as Dr. Jill McCabe for Senate.’<br><br>(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch today released 79 pages of Justice Department documents concerning ethics issues related to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe’s involvement with his wife’s political campaign. The documents include an email showing Mrs. McCabe was recruited for a Virginia state senate race in February 2015 by then-Virginia Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam’s office. The news that former Secretary of State Clinton used a private email server broke five days later, on March 2, 2015. Five days after that, former Clinton Foundation board member and Democrat party fundraiser, Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe, met with the McCabes. She announced her candidacy on March 12. Soon afterward, Clinton/McAuliffe-aligned political groups donated nearly $700,000 (40% of the campaign’s total funds) to McCabe’s wife for her campaign. Judicial Watch obtained the documents through a July 24, 2017, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to respond to an October 24, 2016, FOIA request (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:17-cv-01494)). Judicial Watch seeks:<br><br>- All records of communication between FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe and other FBI or Department of Justice officials regarding ethical issues concerning the involvement of Andrew McCabe and/or his wife, Dr. Jill McCabe, in political campaigns;<br><br>- All records related to ethical guidance concerning political activities provided to Deputy Director McCabe by FBI and/or DOJ officials or elements. An October 23, 2016, email shows McCabe running the response effort to a Wall Street Journal article that was published that day, titled “Clinton Ally Aided Campaign of FBI Official’s Wife.” McCabe provides Michael Kortan, the assistant director of Public Affairs, his version of a timeline of events surrounding the Clinton investigation and his wife’s campaign. McCabe said he contacted then-FBI Chief of Staff Chuck Roseburg about Jill McCabe’s candidacy and was told that “the D [Comey] has no issue with it.” (Judicial Watch earlier this month released documents showing that McCabe finally did recuse himself from the Clinton investigation only a week before last year’s presidential election.) Internally, the Wall Street Journal article started a flurry of emails among Mrs. McCabe’s campaign, Kortan, Director McCabe, and the FBI’s General Counsel. Part of that exchange is an email from McCabe to someone in the General Counsel’s Office: “Sucks pretty much. Buckle in. It’s going to get rough.” The colleague responds, “I know. It’s awful. I shouldn’t be shocked by now, but I really am appalled.” McCabe also forwarded the article to Comey who responded, “Copy.”<br><br>On October 24, 2016, a memo was sent to all Special Agents in Charge, Assistant Directors, Executive Directors and the General Counsel’s Office regarding the Wall Street Journal article discussing campaign activities concerning Mrs. McCabe. Kortan suggested that questions could be referred to his office and he attached an “Overview of Deputy Director McCabe’s Recusal Related To Dr. McCabe’s Campaign for Political Office.” The Overview itself was previously reported by Judicial Watch. The documents also show repeated use of the official FBI email system in connection with Mrs. McCabe’s political campaign. For example:<br><br>- On March 13, 2015, Mrs. McCabe emails to her husband’s official FBI email account a draft press release announcing her run for state Senate. - In August 2015, McCabe uses his official FBI email account to advise a redacted recipient to visit his wife’s campaign website: “Jill has been busy as hell since she decided to run for VA state senate (long story). Check her out on Facebook as Dr. Jill McCabe for Senate.”<br><br>- On November 2, 2015, Mrs. McCabe forwards an email to her husband – then the Assistant Director in Charge of the FBI’s Washington Office – that accuses her opponent of extorting local businessmen. The email was sent to her husband’s official FBI account. The documents include an October 2016 letter from House Government Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz to McCabe questioning a possible conflict of interest by noting that Clinton headlined a Virginia fundraiser on June 26, 2015, for Mrs. McCabe. “A significant amount was donated after the FBI had initiated its investigation and begun meeting with Secretary Clinton’s attorneys in August 2015.”<br><br>The documents also show that FBI leadership was sensitive to reports of FBI internal dissent with then-Director Comey’s handling of the Clinton investigation. On October 24, 2016, Mrs. McCabe forwarded to Director McCabe a True Pundit article titled, “FBI Director Lobbied Against Criminal Charges For Hillary After Clinton Insider Paid His Wife $700,00.” The story reported that former FBI Executive Assistant Director John Giacalone resigned in the middle of the Clinton email investigation because he saw it going “sideways” and that Jill McCabe received money from a PAC headed by McAuliffe, who was under investigation by the FBI for campaign finance law violations. McCabe forwarded the article to Comey, noting “FYI. Heavyweight source.” Comey replied to McCabe, copying Chief of Staff James Rybicki, saying, “This still reads to me like someone not involved in the investigation at all, maybe somebody who heard rumors …”<br><br>“These new documents show that the FBI leadership was politicized and compromised in its handling of the Clinton email investigation,” said Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch President. “It is well past time for a do-over on the Clinton emails that requires a new, honest criminal investigation of her misconduct.”<br><br>The Senate Judiciary Committee and the U.S. Special Counsel have opened investigations into whether McCabe violated the Hatch Act and failed to properly disclose payments to his wife’s campaign on his ethics report. The Justice Department’s Inspector General is examining McCabe for failing to recuse himself from the Clinton investigation due to his meeting with McAuliffe. Judicial Watch filed a separate FOIA suit on behalf of retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent Jeffrey A. Danik against the Department of Justice. Additionally, Judicial Watch filed FOIA lawsuits seeking employment records and communications related to McCabe. ###",2.65,1.13,1.22,2.35,3.87,1.78,0.5499999999999999,0.0433333333333333,0.21999999999999997,0.04151666666666667,0.029154,0.06032222222222223
39,46,24,https://readsludge.com/2018/07/13/theyre-sanctuary-jurisdictions-so-why-are-they-contracting-with-ice,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/biden-trump-philadelphia-pennsylvania.html,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/americas-failure-to-protect-its-children-from-school-shootings-is-a-national-disgrace-parkland-florida,"Several states, counties and cities billed as safe havens for undocumented immigrants seeking reprieve from federal immigration enforcement are continuing to contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement despite being labeled as “sanctuary” jurisdictions. A Sludge analysis of more than 2,200 active contracts with ICE shows that sanctuary cities, including New York City and Philadelphia, as well as sanctuary counties, such as Sacramento, San Diego and Santa Clara, have ongoing contracts with the enforcement agency within the Department of Homeland Security aimed at enforcing immigration laws and removing unauthorized immigrants. With the debate on immigration becoming increasingly heated since the Trump administration began implementing a policy of separating children from their parents who enter the country illegally along southern border, protests have erupted around the nation calling for ICE to be abolished. Sludge identified roughly two dozen local governments and municipalities that either reside in or are sanctuary jurisdiction that have active contracts with ICE. All told, the two-dozen contracts between state and local governments with ICE are valued at $2.09 million, with $1.03 million awarded so far. Several municipalities were unaware of their ongoing contracts with ICE until Sludge reached out for comment. Some contracts between sanctuary jurisdictions and ICE had gone back years, vestiges of the past being continuously renewed with few questions asked. New York<br><br>New York City— whose progressive mayor, Bill de Blasio, has called for ICE to be abolished— is still raking in money from the agency. The city has a $112,000 contract with ICE that began in 2015, was recently renewed in January 2018, and is slated to end in February 2020, records show. Though the New York City Police Department has said it would limit cooperation with ICE agents, the contract between New York City and ICE is listed as a firing range facility rental for education and training purposes located at 1 Police Plaza, the headquarters of the NYPD. The de Blasio administration, which effectively controls the NYPD agenda and issues guidance on policies, declined to comment for this story. In an email, a spokesman for the NYPD said the department’s stance on immigration issues have no connection to their contract with ICE. “The NYPD does not inquire about the immigration status of crime victims, witnesses, or others who call or approach the police seeking assistance,” said spokesman Phil Walzak. “The NYPD does not conduct civil immigration enforcement. These are facts that have no connection to the rental of a firing range facility.”<br><br>The Hudson River Park Trust, a partnership between New York State and New York City, has a $426,000 contract with ICE for “secure parking for the New York field office,” according to its contract. A spokesman for the Hudson River Park Trust, a waterfront park in on Manhattan’s West Side, said in an email that “The Trust has had a series of parking contracts with the Department of Homeland Security for parking in Pier 40’s 2,000-space garage since before 2004, with the latest entered into in May 2016 for 35 spaces used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”<br><br>Despite Cuomo’s rhetoric, the state has continued to contract with ICE. The New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, which is controlled by the state of New York, has a $15,000 contract with ICE to provide license plates, registration and other motor vehicle requirements. The DMV is headquartered in Albany, New York, a sanctuary city. When asked about the contract, a spokeswoman for the New York DMV said the agency “did not find anything” in its contract database about the contract with ICE. A spokesman for the Cuomo administration did not respond to request for comment. Efforts to reach Albany Mayor Kathy Sheehan were also unsuccessful. Reached by Sludge Thursday, Javier H. Valdés, the co-executive director of Make the Road New York, an immigration advocacy organization, said the state and city should end their contract with ICE. “We call on both New York State and New York City to immediately end all contracts with ICE, which is tearing apart immigrants from their families and communities on a daily basis across New York and the country.”<br><br>California<br><br>As a direct rebuke to Trump’s immigration policies, Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation in October 2017 designating California as a sanctuary state, limiting the cooperation of state and local enforcement agencies with federal immigration authorities. Despite the legislation, nothing precludes the state, cities or counties from contracting with ICE because California doesn’t have jurisdiction over local agency contracting, a spokesman for Brown explained. Several counties that have taken the added step of becoming a sanctuary counties, such as Sacramento, Los Angeles, San Mateo, San Diego and Santa Clara, have ongoing contracts with ICE. Last month, the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors opted not to renew its detention contract with ICE, which was expected to bring the county more than $4 million in revenue this fiscal year. The contract could have netted the county more than $6.6 million annually in the upcoming years do to increased per-night charges, Sheriff Scott Jones told the board in a memo. Phil Serna, a member of the board, said at the meeting that he couldn’t find it in himself to keep supporting the ICE contract. “We’re not housing these people, we’re jailing these people,” Serna said. “Some of them don’t have criminal violations.”<br><br>“So to have us consider extending a contract—while it has some fiscal benefit to the county— but results in, what I think, is a quite clear moral abomination. I don’t want to be party to jailing people when they have no criminal violations,” Serna added. While the Sacramento County Board of Supervisors voted not to renew its largest contract with ICE, it still has a much smaller active contract with the agency, according to federal spending records. The county has a $3,660 contract, slated to expire at the end of this month, with ICE allowing the agency to have access to the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS), a network that provides law enforcement access and public safety agencies access to criminal history, driving records and other databases. Santa Clara County, which sued the Trump administration along with Sacramento County over the president’s executive order withholding federal grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that refused to comply with immigration enforcement, also has two active contracts with ICE. One contract between the county and ICE, valued at more than $27,500, is for “online access to criminal justice information,” which gives ICE “limited access to the County’s Criminal Justice Information Control (CJIC) system to look up criminal history information,” said county spokeswoman Laurel Anderson. The other contract is access to the Sheriff’s Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS), valued at more than $2,000, which provides the agency “pass-through access” to the CLETS network, Anderson said. The sheriff’s office is “responsible only for reviewing the application for ICE to receive pass-through access, and is required to submit the application to the California Department of Justice regardless of whether the Sheriff’s Office approves it,” Anderson said in an email. “The Sheriff’s Office does not provide any information to ICE, only pass-through access to the statewide CLETS system under State rules. As the CLETS Control Agency for the County of Santa Clara, the Sheriff’s Office also provides this access to other law enforcement agencies operating in our county.”<br><br>San Diego County, another sanctuary area, has a contract valued at nearly $46,000 for communications security equipment. A spokesman for the county explained that the contract allows ICE to use the Regional Communications System, the regional first responder radio system used in San Diego and Imperial counties. “More than 200 first responder agencies use and lease this system including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement,” San Diego County spokesman Michael Workman said. Connecticut<br><br>Hartford, Connecticut, has been a sanctuary city prior to Trump taking office. But the Hartford Parking Authority, which is charged at maintaining and operating the city’s parking facilities, has a contract with ICE with a potential value of $64,000. So far, more than $38,000 has been awarded to the authority for “secure parking” for the Enforcement and Removal Operations Field Office in Boston. Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin was unaware of the ICE contract, according to a spokesman for the mayor. “The Parking Authority was established twenty years ago as an entity independent of city hall, as required by a Connecticut State statute. That statute was passed because of a perception that, in the past, parking contracts were seen as political handouts. Mayor Bronin is thus not involved in the day to day operations of HPA. He is not aware of any contracts with ICE,” said spokesman Vasishth Srivastava. Colorado<br><br>While the state of Colorado is a sanctuary state, several cities and counties also hold that distinction. The only government entity within the state that has an active contract with ICE is Denver Health and Hospitals, the state-owned health care system. The $9,000 contract is for “funding for detention guard service for ICE detainees admitted to Denver Health and Hospital,” according to the contract. While the city of Denver— a sanctuary city— passed an ordinance last year designed to “reduce fear within the immigrant community and clarify for everyone that Denver is not engaging in immigration enforcement,” Denver Health is not required to abide by the Public Safety Enforcement Priorities Ordinance, according to a city spokeswoman. Illinois<br><br>Cook County and Chicago are both listed as sanctuary areas for immigrants. The village of Oak Lawn, a suburb of Chicago within Cook County, has a contract with ICE valued at $54,000 set to expire in 2021. The contract, of which $18,000 has been awarded to the village, is for “range fees” for training. Efforts to reach Cook County for this story were not successful. Public Colleges<br><br>While several colleges and universities around the country contract with ICE, only two are public institutions residing within sanctuary jurisdictions: The University of Maryland and Vermont State Colleges. The University of Maryland has so far been awarded $125,000 for a contract with ICE on “counter terrorism training” that was renewed in March 2018 and slated to end in 2022. The contract has a potential award value of $625,000, making it one of the largest among state and local entities contracting with ICE that are in sanctuary jurisdictions. A spokeswoman for the the university explained that the contract covers “up to 25, two-day training sessions where university researchers present terrorism-related research findings to homeland security investigators who are sent to US Embassies abroad for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.”<br><br>“Vermont Tech’s position is that the training we have provided doesn’t relate to policing or enforcement,” said spokeswoman Amanda Chaulk. “As a public institution, Vermont Tech strives to maintain open doors to the public that it serves, through its nondiscrimination policy and equal opportunity policies for admission and open enrollment in many programs, especially those offered by [Continuing Education & Workforce Development.] We also seek to provide education where we have expertise, as in these examples of leadership and financial best practices.”<br><br>Chaulk added that the contract with ICE for leadership training ended in late 2017 and a contract for financial accounting courses ended in May.","Trump Put Down Philadelphia. The City Got Payback. A city that “will long remember slights,” as one area congressman put it, came through for Joe Biden, who benefited from his ties there and President Trump’s affronts to its voters. Send any friend a story<br><br>As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. PHILADELPHIA — It was just before noon on Saturday, and Bob Brady was trying to reach Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the phone. Mr. Brady, the chairman of the Philadelphia Democrats, wanted to pass along an increasingly open secret among elections officials and the news media: The city was about to release a tally of roughly 3,000 more votes. The phone was answered by Mr. Biden’s brother James Biden, who relayed Mr. Brady’s bulletin to the candidate sitting next to him. The significance would not have been lost on anyone who had been closely following the ballot-counting process — if the percentages lined up right for Mr. Biden, the votes would put him over the top. And, indeed, just as his brother and Mr. Brady hung up the phone, 2,431 votes from the city moved into Mr. Biden’s column, clinching Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes, and with them, the presidency. Philadelphia and its suburban counties had laid the final brick that rebuilt the proverbial blue wall in 2020, and Democrats here wanted to make sure everyone — especially President Trump — knew it. As the newly counted votes set off a rapid-fire succession of news outlets calling the race for Mr. Biden, the city that heralds itself as the birthplace of American independence from Britain celebrated the toppling of a leader who had provoked its anger. In laying the groundwork for his baseless claims of voter fraud, Mr. Trump had declared from the debate stage that “bad things happen in Philadelphia,” and over the weekend his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani assailed a history of corruption in the city as he pursued unlikely efforts to challenge the election results. But ask Philadelphians about when things turned sour with the president, and many will point back more than two years, to his abrupt cancellation of a traditional White House visit for the city’s beloved Eagles football team after its first ever Super Bowl victory in 2018. In this city with a penchant for deeply held civic grudges, trash talk and impolitic celebrations of its rivals’ travails, where Crisco slathered on telephone poles to prevent climbing is a sign of impending revelry, the blocks around City Hall on Saturday began to resemble the famed Super Bowl parade of 2018. Chest-pumping pride spilled out, with expressions of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden, the former vice president, often overshadowed by feelings of vengeance toward Mr. Trump. “Philly knows how to stand up for itself, and love us or hate us, this is what we do right here,” said Rob Cancel, 37, as he joined the celebration outside the city’s convention center on Saturday sporting a red “Bad things happen in Philadelphia” T-shirt. “We come out, we show up and we show them who we are. We’re a strong, strong, proud people.”<br><br>Others were more direct. “I must say, Philly got to tell him he’s fired. Woo!” said Stephanie Marsh, 40, as she skipped down Arch Street toward the convention center. A widely circulated photograph showed one man holding a sign listing perceived civic adversaries — though it used a different, more profane, word — who had been “defeated by Philadelphia,” including King George III, the former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Mr. Trump. Another photo showed a sign held aloft over revelers noting that Mr. Trump had “disinvited the Eagles to the White House.” It added, “So we returned the favor.”<br><br>“Philadelphia is a city that will long remember slights, and the fact the president of the United States personally, repeatedly, went after us is something that we absolutely took offense to and wanted to fight back against,” said Representative Brendan Boyle, who represents Northeast Philadelphia and was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign. “Donald Trump was insane to pick on Philadelphia. If there was ever a city that anyone should never mess with, it is Philadelphia.”<br><br>Separate from the enmity for Mr. Trump, Philadelphia has long been a base of support — and cash — for Mr. Biden, who has strong ties to the city, having served for 36 years as a senator from neighboring Delaware, during which time he lived in the suburbs of Wilmington, Del., about 45 minutes from Center City in Philadelphia. He was sometimes referred to as “Pennsylvania’s third senator,” though his affinity for the state stems to no small degree from his upbringing in Scranton, more than two hours north of Philadelphia. His wife, Jill Biden, grew up in Philadelphia’s northern suburbs and has maintained its distinct accent, to the approval of discerning Philadelphia ears. The future first couple root for the city’s sports teams, and were on hand for the most glorious moment in its athletic history — the Eagles’ victory over the heavily favored Patriots at the 2018 Super Bowl in Minneapolis. Two of Mr. Biden’s granddaughters have lived in the city and attended the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, which was also the alma mater of Mr. Biden’s son Beau, who died in 2015, and the president-elect’s daughter, Ashley, who reportedly still lived in the city as of last month. After Mr. Biden’s vice presidency, the university became a key part of his professional base, establishing the Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington. He was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars as a professor by the university, and several of his close advisers, including possible appointees in the nascent Biden administration, were affiliated at various times with the center. They include Steve Ricchetti, the Biden campaign’s chairman and the president-elect’s former vice-presidential chief of staff, as well as Brian McKeon, Colin Kahl, Michael Carpenter and Dan Erikson, former advisers to Mr. Biden. When Mr. Biden began his presidential bid, he chose Philadelphia for the campaign’s headquarters, as well as his announcement speech and kickoff fund-raiser, which was held at a home in the city’s leafy West Mount Airy neighborhood belonging to David L. Cohen, a senior executive at Comcast. Mr. Cohen, who is also the chairman of the board of trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, had participated in the ribbon-cutting for the Biden Center. Mr. Biden’s campaign staff had a number of Philadelphia-area natives in prominent roles, including its national political director, Erin Wilson. To increase turnout in the city, Democrats pulled out all of the stops. They called in celebrity reinforcements like Debra Messing and Kathy Najimy and sent them knocking on doors. They lined up John Legend to croon for a packed parking lot. And they dispatched top political surrogates, including former President Barack Obama and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, to campaign in the city. Local Democrats augmented the effort. Representative Dwight Evans organized car caravans to snake through neighborhoods in his district, which includes parts of North Philadelphia and West Philadelphia, honking at residents to remind them to vote. On Sunday, his caravan drove for 35 miles. Philadelphia stretches just 15 miles north to south. “The easy thing about this was, it was not persuasion — you only had to ensure that the process was working,” Mr. Evans said. He added that his own 10th Ward, in the northwest part of the city, had voted for Mr. Biden by 97.5 percent to 2.5 percent over Mr. Trump. “And us doing those car caravans was us explaining that process.”<br><br>Five days before the election, Mr. Biden hopped on a Zoom meeting with Philadelphia Democrats, telling them, “Philadelphia is the place where everything happened for me.” He added: “It’s where I raised my money when I was a senator. It’s where I got support. It’s where I got help.”<br><br>He turned to his friend Bob Brady, the Democratic chairman. “If you’ve got to be in a foxhole, we want you in there with us,” Mr. Biden said. For Mr. Brady, who has led the Democratic Party in this city for 34 years, the effort in Philadelphia was personal. Mr. Brady and Mr. Biden are close, having grabbed countless “steaks on the go” through the years, perfecting the familiar lean of bending at the hips to avoid cheesesteak stains on their clothes. After Mr. Obama asked him to be his running mate in 2008, Mr. Biden called his wife, and his next call went to Mr. Brady. “People were asking how much pressure I had on me because he is my friend,” Mr. Brady said. “A ton of pressure. A ton of pressure.”<br><br>And on the Sunday before Election Day, Mr. Biden spoke to canvassers gathered by Congressman Boyle at the campaign headquarters that he shares with his brother, Kevin J. Boyle, a Pennsylvania state representative, in Northeast Philadelphia. Mr. Biden told the crowd, “We have an expression where I come from: You never forget those who brung you to the dance.”<br><br>He thanked Congressman Boyle, saying that “we owe Brendan” for his endorsement on “the day I announced,” and that “it brought along everything else that’s happened.”<br><br>When the race was called for Mr. Biden, Mr. Boyle, who gave leave to two of his congressional aides to work in the Biden campaign’s political shop, tweeted: “WE DID IT! PHILLY PUTS BIDEN OVER THE TOP IN PENNSYLVANIA!”<br><br>In an interview on Monday, the congressman, who is said to be under consideration for a possible administration post, predicted that a Biden administration would be receptive to the concerns of the Philadelphia area, and not just because of its role in his election. “It helps to have someone in the White House at the top who is very familiar with our area and cares about it,” Mr. Boyle said. Nick Corasaniti reported from Philadelphia, and Kenneth P. Vogel from Washington.","Early on Wednesday afternoon, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, had a fire drill, an eleventh-grader named Gabriella Figueroa told MSNBC’s Brian Williams. “Then we heard gunshots,” Figueroa said. “Then it went to code red. And then it was crazy.”<br><br>An individual with deadly intent was in the school building, holding an assault weapon that was designed for fighting wars. As Figueroa’s use of the term “code red” indicated, such an event is no longer considered an aberration. All across the country, school boards drill their teachers and students in how to respond to such an emergency. Code yellow: turn cell phones to silent, return to the classroom, and follow the teacher’s instructions. Code red: find a secure area immediately, lock the door, close the blinds, turn off the lights, do not move. This lockdown wasn’t a drill, of course. By the time it was over, seventeen people had been shot dead, and more than a dozen had been wounded. “Bodies were lying in the hallway,” another eyewitness told Fox News. “People were killed in the hallway.” Police later identified the suspected killer as Nikolas Cruz, a nineteen-year-old former student who had been expelled for discipline problems. After Cruz fled the scene—he was arrested shortly after the shooting, in neighboring Coral Springs—news helicopters captured footage of students walking and running from the school, some of them carrying flowers and cards. It was Valentine’s Day, after all. By that point, the authorities had secured the area around the school. There were heavily armed cops, police cars, bomb-squad trucks, and F.B.I. vehicles. The mayor of Parkland, a former teacher named Beam Furr, told CNN, “It’s all being fairly well coördinated, and everyone is doing everything they can.”<br><br>But were they? On Twitter, President Donald Trump offered his “prayers and condolences to the families of the victims,” adding that “no child, teacher, or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.” Fox News interviewed Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, who has an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. “I hope people reserve judgment.... The facts of this are important,” Rubio said. As soon as the facts are clear, Rubio went on, “we can have a deeper conversation about why these things happen.” The forty-six-year-old Republican added, “It’s a terrible situation. It’s amazing the amount of carnage that one individual can carry out in such a short period of time.”<br><br>Yet some pertinent facts are already known. According to local police, Cruz was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle—the same type of gun that Adam Lanza used to kill twenty-six pupils and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in December, 2012. Evidently, Rubio still isn’t aware of the power of such weapons, which fire bullets that can penetrate a steel helmet from a distance of five hundred yards. When fired from close range at civilians who aren’t wearing body armor, the bullets from an AR-15 don’t merely penetrate the human body—they tear it apart. It “looks like a grenade went off in there,” Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at the University of Arizona, told Wired. To spare the families of the victims—and the public at large—additional anguish, these sorts of details are often glossed over in the aftermath of mass shootings. But it’s surely long past time that we acknowledged these facts, and that we begin to more fully discuss the complicity of N.R.A.-backed politicians like Rubio, and Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, in maintaining the environment that allows these tragedies to happen again and again and again. One of the first duties of any government is to protect its citizens, through collective action, from violent threats they’d otherwise have to fend off themselves. Even most libertarians accept this principle. But when it comes to mass shootings, the Republican Party falls back on constitutional arguments that have no proper basis in history, and it refuses to budge from this stance. Nothing can shift it—not Sandy Hook, not the Orlando night-club shooting, not the Las Vegas massacre, not weekly shootings in schools. (According to the Guardian, Wednesday’s attack in Parkland was the eighth school shooting this year that has resulted in death or injury.) Nothing. The Democrats aren’t entirely blameless, either. In 2009 and 2010, when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, they failed to take some steps that were obviously necessary, such as closing the gun-show loophole for background checks and reinstating the Clinton Administration’s ban on assault weapons, which the Bush Administration allowed to expire. The Republicans bear the primary responsibility, though. Ever since Sandy Hook, it is their craven subservience to the gun lobby that has prevented meaningful action, even as the carnage that Rubio referred to has continued. “Turn on your televisions right now and you are going to see scenes of children running for their lives,” Chris Murphy, the junior Democratic senator for Connecticut, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon. “Let me just note once again for my colleagues: this happens nowhere else other than the United States of America. This epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting, it only happens here. Not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction. We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.”<br><br>The key concept in that excellent peroration was responsibility.

Clinton on board a parked private plane on the west side of Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona on June 29, 2016, according to multiple press reports. President Clinton is the spouse of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former Secretary of State, who is purportedly the subject of a national security crime investigation pertaining to the mishandling of national defense information processed by Mrs. Clinton’s personal server during her tenure as secretary. Additionally, there are press reports that a federal public corruption investigation is on-going concerning conflicts of interest and abuse of official government office involving the financial “commitments” to the Clinton Foundation, speaking fees for President Clinton and former Secretary Clinton’s official acts. President Clinton may be a target of that investigation. Attorney General Lynch’s meeting with President Clinton creates the appearance of a violation of law, ethical standards and good judgment. Attorney General Lynch’s decision to breach the well-defined ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession is an outrageous abuse of the public’s trust. Her conduct and statements undermine confidence in her ability to objectively investigate and prosecute possible violations of law associated with President Clinton and Secretary Clinton. This incident undermines the public’s faith in the fair administration of justice. Simply stated, Attorney General Lynch’s June 29, 2016 meeting with former President Clinton creates the broad public impression that “the fix is in.”<br><br>Judicial Watch requests your immediate and thorough investigation of the facts, circumstances, and appearances of ethical, regulatory and legal violations by Attorney General Lynch in connection with her meeting with former President William J. Clinton – and that you report your findings and recommendations to the American public. Judicial Watch cites in its complaint 18 USC §§ 202 – 209; Executive Order 12674 on Principles of Ethical Conduct as amended by EO 12731; Uniform Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, 5 CFR Part 2635; Department of Justice regulations, 5 CFR Part 3801; Department of Justice regulations, 28 CFR Part 45; Executive branch standards of conduct, 5 USC § 735; and, United States Department of Justice Ethics Handbook for On and Off-Duty Conduct, 14 Principles for Ethical Conduct:<br><br>“14.

Instead of just taking them down, Mr. Suber, an African-American activist and organizer, would like to see the city pass out sledgehammers and “let everybody take a whack — just like the Berlin Wall.”<br><br>For Frank B. Stewart Jr., a white New Orleans native, the city government’s plan to remove the statues — an idea championed by New Orleans’s white mayor, Mitch Landrieu — feels like an Orwellian attempt to erase history. Last week, Mr. Stewart, 81, a businessman and civic leader, argued as much in a letter he published as a two-page advertisement in The Advocate, a local newspaper. “I ask you, Mitch, should the Pyramids in Egypt be destroyed since they were built entirely from slave labor?” he wrote. Mr. Stewart also wondered about the Roman Colosseum: “It was built by slaves, who lived horrible lives under Roman oppression, but it still stands today and we learn so much from seeing it.”<br><br>Such are the irreconcilable parameters of an ugly battle over race and history in New Orleans that seems to only be growing uglier, one that demonstrates the Confederacy’s enduring power to divide Americans more than 150 years after the cause was lost. “I can’t believe this is happening in my city,” said Charles Washmon, a 51-year-old contractor who was standing near a statue of Jefferson Davis, the Confederate president, on Thursday. Mr. Washmon, who is white, was part of a group of protesters waving Confederate flags who had been attracting both honks of support and invectives from passing cars all afternoon. Like Mr. Stewart, he feared that removing the statues would deprive a history-laden city of a crucial layer of its past. “It’s a travesty,” Mr. Washmon said. In December 2015, Mr. Landrieu, a Democrat who will leave office next year because of term limits, signed an ordinance calling for the removal of four monuments related to the Confederacy and its aftermath. It was six months after Dylann Roof, a white supremacist with a fondness for Confederate symbols, massacred nine black people in a church in Charleston, S.C. One of the monuments, an obelisk honoring a violent uprising in 1874 by white New Orleanians who rejected Reconstruction, was taken down on April 24 by workers wearing flak jackets and scarves to conceal their identities. The unease has only grown since then. Mr. Landrieu has said that the city plans to remove the remaining three monuments — first the statue of Davis, then those of two Confederate generals, P. G. T. Beauregard and Robert E. Lee — over the next month or so, though he has not announced exact dates. Last week, the statue of Beauregard was slathered in red paint by vandals. And Confederate sympathizers and fans of the statues have been flocking to the city from as far away as New Mexico and Colorado to protest their removal. On Monday night, defenders of the statues squared off against a large group of opponents near the Davis statue in the Mid-City area. “Get the hell out of New Orleans,” the multiracial group of opponents sang, to the tune of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” using much stronger language, “because you’re not wanted here.”<br><br>The police arrested five people on charges of disturbing the peace and other infractions, and city officials have surrounded the statue with barricades and police guards. But the crowds continued to gather, and some defenders of the statues have come heavily armed. A man who referred to himself only as K. K. walked along a median on Tuesday carrying an AK-47, with a Glock handgun on his waist. Mr. Landrieu has said the city is sticking to the plan, though it appears that will not be easy. Removing the remaining statues will require the use of a heavy crane, and the mayor told The Times-Picayune that every crane company in the region had received threats. On Sunday afternoon, anti-statue protesters numbering 500, according to police estimates, took to the streets in a boisterous second line parade through the French Quarter and downtown, ending at Lee Circle, the roundabout where the Lee statue is. There, they faced off against about 150 protesters who had come from all over the country in a show of support for the statue. Some of the counterdemonstators brandished Confederate battle flags. Some exhibited Pepe the Frog insignia and other trappings of the so-called alt-right, a fringe movement that embraces white nationalism. And some wore improvised battle gear, including bike helmets, shin guards and homemade shields. But the New Orleans Police Department had erected barriers to separate the two groups. Louisiana is an open-carry gun state, but police officials had warned that guns would be banned at Sunday’s protest, citing a city ordinance. One local man had brought large speakers that he used to crank out pop tunes, including Abba’s “Dancing Queen,” a soundtrack that helped transform the proceedings from ominous to farcical. Beau Tidwell, the communications director for the Police Department, said that three people were arrested Sunday for disturbing the peace over minor scuffles. Still, the rising tensions came at an awkward time for the city, and for the mayor. This is the season when the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival takes center stage, showing off to thousands of tourists the glories of Louisiana’s musical multiculturalism and its deep ties to Africa, the Caribbean, Latin America and the white rural South. For Mr. Landrieu, who declined to be interviewed, the trouble also underscores the difficulties he has faced in meeting his goal of bringing racial harmony to New Orleans. The city is 60 percent black and 33 percent white, and it is burdened by severe economic disparities. Mr. Landrieu’s father, Maurice Edwin Landrieu, known as Moon, served as mayor from 1970 to 1978, and he earned the respect of many black residents by opening up the city’s contracting jobs to them. The current mayor, who enjoys some of that good will, said in a statement in late April that the statues would be moved to a museum “or other facility where they can be put in context,” and thus show the world that New Orleans celebrates “diversity, inclusion and tolerance.”<br><br>The statement also noted that the statues were erected decades after the end of the war and were meant to “demonstrate that there was no sense of guilt for the cause in which the South fought the Civil War.”<br><br>Wesley Lynch III, a 25-year-old African-American, said the gesture was an important one. Mr. Lynch was standing by the flag-wavers near the Davis statue on Thursday, having encountered them after paying his light bill at the nearby power company office. He is unemployed — his last job was at a Popeyes chicken restaurant — and he spoke, with passion and despair, about the statues not as relics, but as living symbols of a social order that, from his experience, wanted people like him to rise only so far. “They’re putting that image right in our face and saying, ‘Blacks at the bottom, whites at the top,’” he said. “That’s what they’re saying.”<br><br>The supporters of the statues run the gamut. Among them is David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who has run for office several times in Louisiana. Rather predictably, he sees the removals as “destroying our heritage” and has called Mr. Landrieu “a traitorous cuck,” deploying a slur used by white nationalists and the alt-right to insult politicians as weak and unmanly. There are many, however, like Mr. Stewart, who profess no love for either white supremacy or slavery. Mr. Stewart said the statues serve as a reminder of society’s evolution away from such noxious ideas — proof, he said, that “we have come a long way from our ancestors.”<br><br>A number of the statue supporters keeping vigil by the Davis monument agreed with that sentiment, adding that they did not believe the Civil War had been fought over slavery. “It really was an economic issue,” K. K., the man with the AK-47, said on Tuesday. Others said they worried that the removals would create a slippery slope. Where would it end, they asked? Would a statue of George Washington be next? Such concerns were unlikely to be assuaged by Mr. Suber, an adjunct professor of political science at Southern University, an avowed Marxist-Leninist, and an organizer of an anti-statue group called the Take ’Em Down NOLA Coalition. He noted that he had been part of a group that persuaded the Orleans Parish School Board to pass a policy in 1992 that prohibited schools from being named for slave owners. It eventually led to a school called George Washington Elementary being renamed for Dr. Charles Richard Drew, a prominent black surgeon. On Thursday, Mr. Suber chuckled mischievously and said he would be delighted to see the statue of Washington over by the New Orleans Public Library come down, too. “He was a slave master,” he said. “Right?”",2.4699999999999998,1.7,1.8,1.53,2.3,1.2,0.7349999999999999,0.35,0.8,0.047238749999999996,0.048874999999999995,0.060000000000000005

She was picturing a life in which women were viewed as equal to men, able to earn an income, able to speak their mind, and treated with respect. But in that vision, did Stanton see a world with abortion on demand? Did any of the major players in early feminism aim for such a thing? No, the early feminists fought for women’s rights, and they did not include abortion. The first feminists of the United States of America didn’t want what today’s liberal feminists spend their time fighting for — total and complete ‘reproductive freedom.’ They saw abortion for what it is: the oppression of women and children. Stanton said:<br><br>When we consider that women have been treated as property, it is degrading to women that we should treat our children as property to be disposed of as we see fit. In the February 5, 1868, issue of The Revolution, Stanton referred to the “murder of children, either before or after birth” as an “evil” which had become “frightfully prevalent.”<br><br>Along with Stanton, Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in the United States, spoke out against abortion. Concerning Madame Restell, a fellow female doctor who committed abortions, Blackwell said:<br><br>The gross perversion and destruction of motherhood by the abortionist filled me with indignation, and awakened active antagonism. That the honorable term ‘female physician’ should be exclusively applied to those women who carried on this shocking trade seemed to me a horror. It was an utter degradation of what might and should become a noble position for women. The thought of killing preborn children was a horrible one to our first feminists. They could never have foreseen that an act they considered “evil” and a “gross perversion and destruction of motherhood” would become the center-stage issue that it is today. So focused on abortion are the liberal feminists of the 21st century that politicians are beholden to the abortion industry, accepting money from groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood in exchange for votes against even popular laws such as the banning of abortion after viability. So how did feminism lead us to today’s worship of abortion? Another early feminist, Susan B. Anthony, nailed it when she said:<br><br>All the articles on this subject [abortion] that I have read have been from men. They denounce women as alone guilty, and never include man in any plans for the remedy. . . Guilty? Yes. No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed [abortion]. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh, thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime! It would be men who would add abortion to feminism’s to-do list. In fact, even into the 1960s, the women’s movement remained focused on issues such as women’s right to education and equal pay. The so-called right to abortion was not a goal of feminists even 100 years after Stanton and other first feminists began the movement for women’s rights. Abortion did not take center stage until a few bad men stepped in and worked to convince the women’s movement to take on the pet issues of sexual revolution advocates — including contraception and abortion. Journalist Sue Ellen Browder’s book Subverted highlights how Lawrence Lader and abortionist Bernard Nathanson founded NARAL and concluded that they needed feminists on board with them if they wanted to get abortion legalized. After years of trying to persuade her, Lader convinced Betty Friedan to include abortion in her political platform despite the fact that Friedan was initially against abortion. Lader convinced Friedan and other women that they needed abortion in order to be truly equal. He did this by grossly exaggerating the number of women who were undergoing illegal abortions and how many of those women were dying from abortion. In order for the sexual revolution to “work,” men needed to avoid accountability, and the best way to remain uncommitted and unaccountable to women was to ensure that children were never born as a result of their sexual affairs. Over time, women became convinced that it was their children who were holding them back from accomplishing equality. Rather than celebrating the differences between men and women and the equality that exists within and in spite of those differences, women became convinced that they had to be the same as men. Men are never questioned about their ability to do their job because of the number of children they have. Men are not routinely told they cannot get a college degree and be a father at the same time. Men are not overlooked for a promotion because their wife is pregnant. No, it was and still remains women who are told that parenting does not allow for other goals, dreams, or accomplishments. It became common belief that if women wanted to be equal to men, they had to deny the basic and beautiful biological difference between the two sexes. They had to refuse life to their children. Today, over 70 percent of women who abort say they felt pressured to do so. That pressure comes from the men — and now fellow women, too — who convince these women they can never finish their education or continue their career with a child in tow. The pressure comes from boyfriends or husbands who threaten to leave them if they don’t have an abortion. The pressure comes from parents who threaten to kick a girl out on the streets because she has embarrassed their family. These pressures are overwhelming because women don’t feel they can raise a child alone. And yet, they can. True feminism shows them that. READ: What to do if your boyfriend – or anyone – wants you to get an abortion<br><br>While it is ideal for men and women to work together caring for children as a family, the sexual revolution hijacked the women’s movement and made it acceptable for men to walk away from their children. With abortion, women were made to feel that they should also walk away from their babies. Women often feel that abortion is their only choice, but it’s not. Many a strong modern woman has given life to her child, defying her circumstances. READ: I was scheduled to be aborted, but my mom had the strength to walk out<br><br>Freedom doesn’t come from your back being up against the wall. Abortion doesn’t mean equality. It isn’t synonymous with freedom. Abortion is oppression. Stanton, Blackwell, and Anthony knew it in the late 1800s and early 1900s. That’s why they never fought for it. That’s why they pointed it out as evil. That’s why they noticed that it was men who wanted abortion, not women. If men and women work together in complete and true equality, balancing each other’s strengths and reaching together for common goals, then women can experience true freedom, along with their children. Perhaps then, the goals of our first feminists can finally be obtained. READ: Pregnant and feeling alone? You’re not. Here’s where to get help","Once again Judicial Watch is doing the heavy lifting.

This behavior has been on stark display during Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court confirmation hearings. To briefly recap how this circus came to town over the past two weeks:<br><br>Sen. Dianne Feinstein (R-Calif.) received a letter in July from Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Kavanaugh of attempting to sexually assault her 35 years ago when they were both in high school. Instead of immediately sharing the letter and alerting the FBI of it so they could check out Ford’s accusations, what did Feinstein do? She held that letter back and [according to her] didn’t show it to anyone else on the Senate Judiciary Committee. She didn’t say one word to Kavanaugh in either open or closed sessions during his confirmation hearings about Ford’s allegations—though she was given ample opportunity to question him at length. Then only after the hearings concluded and just before the vote would be held to send Kavanaugh’s nomination to the Senate floor for a full vote, either Feinstein or someone on her staff leaked the letter to the media. What happened next is stunning: Only the Republican senators and their staff on the panel immediately began investigating the letter and its claims, while the Democratic senators and their staff refused to participate in any way. As the three people Ford named as her witnesses were contacted, or gave sworn statements through their lawyers, it was only Republican senators and their staff doing the investigating because the Democrats had all stayed away. In their statements, every person Ford named as a witness said they had no knowledge of the events she described. Ford then was asked to come to Washington so that the committee could interview her. Through her lawyers (one of whom was referred to her by Feinstein) Ford claimed a fear of flying and couldn’t make a scheduled Sept. 24 hearing. The hearing was then delayed another three days and finally, on Sept. 27, Ford came to Washington and, along with Kavanaugh, gave riveting testimony on live TV to the Senate committee. During this hearing, Republican senators deferred their questions to career sex-crimes prosecutor Rachel Mitchell. Her questioning led Ford into claiming she couldn’t remember key details of events from just a few weeks or days ago, such as a polygraph examination or a meeting with Washington Post reporters. Demonstrating such an unreliable memory when making 35-year-old claims doesn’t help one’s case. Mitchell then went on to demonstrate that Ford and her lawyers deliberately lied both to the committee and to the media, when it was claimed she couldn’t possibly make the Sept. 24 appearance because she had a fear of flying. As it turns out, Ford admitted that she has frequently flown, including on vacations in Hawaii and Costa Rica. Mitchell got Ford to reveal that she has an unreliable memory and that she had lied to the committee on at least one issue before showing up for the hearing. It was very revealing that during the course of the Sept. 27 hearing, Ford lawyer Michael Bromwich didn’t speak up or interrupt the questioning until Mitchell asked Ford when she first learned of the committee’s offer to send investigators to interview her in California. As Ford looked perplexed at the question, Bromwich couldn’t grab the microphone fast enough to assert attorney/client privileged communication to attempt to end that line of questioning. Despite Bromwich’s efforts, Ford then testified she had no idea such an offer had been made and if she had known, she would have gladly accepted it. Mitchell later gently pointed out to Ford that if she had been informed of the committee’s offer to send investigators to interview her in California, she wouldn’t be sitting in the middle of the nationally televised circus she presently found herself in. She would have been interviewed in private and her identity would have been kept confidential. Instead, because of her victimization by somebody on the Democratic side of the aisle, she was left to testify live on TV in front of the whole world. That raises this question: If Ford was telling the truth that she didn’t know about the offer to send Senate staff to California to interview her privately, who kept this information from her? Another instance that led to Bromwich grabbing the microphone and interrupting the questioning was when Mitchell asked Ford when she first requested an FBI investigation into her allegation. As Ford looked at Bromwich and her other attorney, Debra Katz, in obvious bewilderment, Bromwich again asserted attorney-client privilege. So, I can’t help but wonder just how much information is being hidden from Ford by her own lawyers. During the day-long hearings, every single Democratic senator repeatedly and endlessly called for a delay of Kavanaugh’s confirmation vote so that the FBI could investigate Ford’s allegations. Some of them demanded that Kavanaugh himself ask for the FBI to investigate while his confirmation vote is delayed. It’s crystal-clear what’s happened here: Ford’s letter was held back so it could be used as a stalling tactic to delay the confirmation vote. Democratic Party leadership has gone all-in on a strategy of using any means necessary to delay a confirmation vote until after the midterm elections on Nov. 6, at which time they hope to have regained control of the Senate, and also the ability to vote down any Supreme Court nominees Trump sends before that body. That’s looking increasingly like a fool’s hope. The Democrats’ vile tactics against Kavanaugh are already massively backfiring on them, with more than a month still to go to the midterm elections. The increasingly vile and desperate slanders of Kavanaugh—which now include claims that at age 17 he was part of a group of high schoolers that drugged and raped girls—are turning sane people with a conscience against this Democratic Party leadership. At any rate, a one-week investigation by the FBI into Ford’s claims is underway. Now that she is on the record and under oath, it’ll be interesting to see what happens next.

The entire debate would be dramatically different if at least three points about mass public shootings ever got coverage: Shootings keep occurring in places where civilians are banned from having guns, almost any modern firearm can be used to inflict mass casualties and armed citizens prevent many attacks from becoming mass public shootings. The horrible attack that left three dead in Gilroy, California, on Sunday was a major focus of the Democratic presidential debates this week. The shooting occurred in yet another place where the victims weren’t allowed to be armed. Although the media consistently noted that people had to pass through metal detectors and that the killer had to cut his way through a back fence, there was no explicit acknowledgement this was a “gun-free zone.” Virtually all mass public shootings occur in gun-free zones. In Gilroy the police were nearby, but this isn’t usually the case and even in this case the attacker was still able to harm many people before the police could help. Killers wait until there are no police in the immediate vicinity. Even if an officer is in the right place at the right time, his uniform is a neon sign saying, “Shoot me first.”<br><br>Consider the extreme measures taken to establish security within Capitol Hill buildings: Two armed guards at every pedestrian and vehicle entrance, X-rays and metal detectors, stone walls on buildings, snipers on roof-tops, armed guards inside and out, and congressmen can have firearms in their offices. Obviously, no one proposes to replicate this level of security for every public venue or workplace. As Ron Noble, who served as Interpol secretary general for 15 years noted, there are two ways to protect people from mass shootings: “One is to say we want an armed citizenry; you can see the reason for that. Another is to say the enclaves [should be] so secure that in order to get into the soft target you’re going to have to pass through extraordinary security.”<br><br>In the last few years, law-abiding concealed handgun carriers have stopped dozens of shootings that would have become mass public shootings. Law enforcement officers have even attested to the fact that there would have been many fatalities if not for the armed citizens’ actions. Legal carriers of concealed handguns save so many lives, and don’t accidentally harm innocent bystanders. Unfortunately, law-abiding Californians are disarmed by bureaucracy even more so than by metal detectors and gun-free-zone signs. In Santa Clara County, where the attack occurred, just 113 people had concealed handgun permits — that is only one permit for every 14,300 adults. In the states outside of California and New York, about one in 11 adults nationwide possess permits. Even in the unlikely event that the national news media covers an attack that was stopped by a permit holder, that critical part of the story gets left out. Only the local news media got the story right when, last October, a concealed handgun permit holder stopped a racist attacker who was shooting black shoppers at a Kroger grocery store in Louisville, Kentucky. National media outlets such as ABC, CNN and NBC noted that the alleged gunman told another white man: “Whites don’t kill whites.” It sounded as if the gunman was merely assuring a white bystander of his safety. But that bystander was a permit holder who was pointing a gun at the killer. What the killer actually said was: “Don’t shoot me. I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites.” The national media got the story backward. The wrong lesson to take from the Gilroy attack is that a ban on a type of gun would make people safer. The killer got around California’s ban on certain semi-automatic rifles by buying his gun legally in Nevada. This led California Gov. Gavin Newsom to blame Republicans for not supporting a national ban on “assault rifles.” All the Democratic presidential candidates also support such a ban. But the vast majority of guns sold in the United States, including most handguns, are semi-automatics, and they can fire just as quickly as these so-called “assault rifles.” In fact, even a rudimentary shotgun fires more than one projectile with a single pull of the trigger, and simple revolvers can fire six shots as quickly as a semi-automatic handgun. Banning a specific type of gun is an unserious solution that ignores reality. Virtually any gun sold today can be used to inflict mass casualties. Attacks become massacres when there’s no one to fight back. Policy makers should acknowledge that mass public shooters seek out so called gun-free zones and the only practical way to protect the public is to allow citizens the tools to protect themselves until police can respond. • John Lott is the president of the Crime Prevention Research Center.

White children outside the black family’s house they had set on fire during the Chicago race riot of 1919.Credit...Getty Images<br><br>Send any friend a story<br><br>As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. Dr. Green is a professor of history at the University of Chicago. “The relation of whites and Negroes in the United States is our most grave and perplexing domestic problem.” So wrote the authors of “The Negro in Chicago,” a landmark 1922 study of a race riot that ripped through that city a century ago this summer. That conflagration, which began on July 27, consumed the city for three days and left 38 people dead and 537 injured. Whites set fire to scores of black-owned houses, leaving a thousand African-Americans homeless. For several nights, gangs of white youth rampaged through black neighborhoods, targeting blacks who defended themselves by sniping back from behind makeshift street barricades. On Monday, July 28, the worst day of violence, white rioters pulled blacks off streetcars at busy South Side intersections and beat them with planks, pipes, bricks and fists. The next morning, a roving gang of whites, including soldiers and sailors in uniform, swept through the downtown streets of the Loop, killing two blacks and injuring many more. Large portions of the second-largest city in America became battlegrounds for open race war, which only rain and deployment of reserve guardsmen managed to quell. The riots began after a weekend of racial skirmishes at a Lake Michigan beach, culminating in the drowning of a black teenager named Eugene Williams who had been stoned by a white mob incensed that he had swum into a “whites only” area. But that was just the spark; deeper factors were at work pushing the city toward violence. Chicago was experiencing the first of several waves of migration — its black population doubled between 1915 and 1920, with most new arrivals coming from the South and settling in the neighborhoods below downtown. Almost overnight, the South Side emerged as a social, cultural and institutional center for African-Americans. That community would gestate modern blues, soul and gospel; landmark mass-market journalism; the largest black Protestant and nationalist churches; and, in time, the first black president. In 1919, though, the South Side’s demographic revolution was seen as a threat by many of the city’s whites, many of them themselves recent arrivals from Europe. As black workers claimed industrial jobs in the South Side’s steel mills and stockyards, whites feared they would depress wages and undercut union power as strikebreakers. Whites also worried about the black vote: Among the incentives to migrate from the Jim Crow South was the chance to cast a ballot. In April 1919, black voters, aligned with the Republicans since Reconstruction, provided the margin of victory for the party’s candidate in a divisive mayoral election — a result that, for many whites, confirmed their role as public enemy. Chicago was not yet completely segregated, but by 1919 black homeowners and renters were concentrated in a narrow band of the South Side that came to be known as the “Black Belt,” chiefly the blocks east and west of State Street from 21st to 47th Streets. Those few African-Americans wealthy or intrepid enough to breach those boundaries were subject to harassment, intimidation and even bombings. The Hyde Park neighborhood just south of the Black Belt, the site of the Columbian Exposition in 1893 and home to the University of Chicago, was one of the most intolerant neighborhoods. Property owned by a wealthy black businessman named Jesse Binga was bombed six times. Mary Bryon Clarke, another black homeowner in greater Hyde Park, had her properties targeted by bombs three times, even though the previous owners of two of her buildings had run them as brothels. Such outbursts along the border of black and white Chicago fed into a general racial hostility. White newspapers resorted to dialect and minstrel-like scenarios to demean blacks and discredit their claim to housing and job opportunities. Black papers stressed a worsening climate of racial violence locally and nationally — often to sensationalized extremes — and denounced the unwillingness on the part of city authorities, especially the police, to protect African-Americans’ rights. These factors did not make the 1919 riot inevitable. Once the conflict started, though, they made its escalation unavoidable. The worst of the violence — whites pulling blacks off street cars, hunting them down in the streets — were led by members of so-called athletic clubs, with names like the Hamburgers, Ragen’s Colts, the Sparklers and the Emeralds. These groups, funded and, when needed, protected by local Democratic ward bosses, were bent on revenging their party’s defeat in the mayor’s election that year. Richard Daley, the future mayor and political dynast, was a member of the Hamburgers and allegedly took part in the violence — accusations that only burnished his reputation, later on, as a loyal neighborhood son willing to fight for the “integrity” of his turf. As the riot spread, it followed the paths laid out by previous episodes of violence along the emerging boundaries of the Black Belt, or centered on contested areas where blacks were buying and renting property, but were not yet securely established in numbers. The generalized terror of the rioting emboldened whites to establish a racial quarantine of sorts, using sudden, brutal mob action to lay down a border between white and black Chicago. For whites who hesitated, unfounded rumors of a black “invasion” moved them to action: Stories of blacks breaking into armories and preparing to “clean out” white neighborhoods to the west were taken as justification for pre-emptive strikes. The police played a crucial role as well. During the first few hours of the violence, 2,800 officers, out of 3,500 total, were deployed along the edges of the Black Belt, forming a cordon. The police claimed they were separating the antagonists, but their strategy left few officers to patrol the rest of the city. The Tuesday morning rampage through the Loop, for example, took place while only two officers were detailed to cover the entire downtown. And the “dead line” cordon intended to separate the races worked only if the police were as committed to preventing white assailants from coming in as they were to keeping blacks from going out. This proved not to be the case: Much of the worst violence took place within the Black Belt itself. In some cases, white officers rode along with the white gangs to shield them from arrest. In others, when officers responded to attacks on blacks, they failed to collect sufficient evidence from the scene, ensuring that few assailants were prosecuted (only 47 people were indicted) and signaling that they would turn a blind eye toward most violence. Although they made up two-thirds of the over 500 recorded casualties, blacks were indicted at double the rate of whites — the first clear instance of racial disparity in city criminal justice, but by no means the last. Chicago was not the only city to experience racial violence in mid-1919, a period that soon earned the name “Red Summer.” Nationwide, reported George Haynes, a black statistician with the Department of Labor, 38 racial disturbances took place that year. A week before, in Washington, white soldiers back home from Europe, fought black civilians in the streets for four days in the wake of sensational newspaper accounts of a sex crime. Reporters noted that, unlike in previous race riots, casualties mounted on both sides of the color line — evidence, many said, of a growing black militancy. That same year Claude McKay wrote his classic poem “If We Must Die,” in which he captured a spirit of black self-preservation in the face of white violence. The poem implicitly aligned African-Americans with global currents of self-determination and nationalism swirling from Dublin to Prague to Jerusalem. Such gains in racial consciousness were limited, however, by the complexities and contradictions of race in America: While the violent experiences of 1919 left blacks more unified and “modern” in their self-determination, the same went for whites — in ways that fortified their resolve to go on exercising power and dominance, in spite of the progressive promise of the age. If the 1920s saw an upsurge in black culture and awareness, it also saw a sustained, violent backlash by whites, from the rebirth of the Klan to an epidemic of lynching to housing segregation. That backlash was on stark display in Chicago. The city’s white real estate agents helped pioneer new tactics in segregation. By 1927 the Chicago Real Estate Board had drafted its own version of a restrictive covenant, a binding contract enjoining white homeowners from selling property to nonwhites. Within a decade, such contracts governed three-fourths of Chicago’s residential property. Upheld routinely by municipal judges, restrictive covenants carried the force of law until overturned by the Supreme Court in 1948. Other measures, including redlining, contract selling, mortgage discrimination and steering, maintained racial exclusion across much of Chicago long after the passage of national civil rights laws in the 1960s. Together with continued discrimination against black renters, and an expansive public housing system dedicated to shifting poorer African-Americans out of the general housing market, these policies deepened racial separation in the city with each passing decade. By 1970, census data certified Chicago as a hyper-segregated municipality, a designation it would retain until the start of the new millennium. The collateral effects of this separation consigned blacks to grossly unequal resources and outcomes related to employment, education, housing, health and safety that inform the stark social problems of the city today. Deepening segregation also institutionalized starkly disparate treatment by the police. As the riot demonstrated, personal prejudice among patrolmen had always been a problem, even though the city employed a surprising number of black officers. The existence of prejudice among individual police did not necessarily mean that Chicago’s police department was, institutionally speaking, racist. But that would steadily change. Measures intended to modernize the police force — car patrols, information technology as a tool for deploying resources — ended up focusing enforcement on black residential areas. By the turn of this century, that approach had yielded some of the most egregious examples of police abuse in the nation’s history, including the pre-emptive execution of the Black Panther leaders Fred Hampton and Mark Clark in 1969; the South Side torture scandal masterminded by Jon Burge, a Chicago police commander; and the crisis of officer-related shootings — which, by the first years of the 21st century, had cost the city over half a billion dollars in settlement payments. Chicago’s 1919 Race Riot was a bridge toward, as well as a break from, a racial order. That order, the Riot and its aftermath revealed was rooted in sophisticated institutions, dynamic city growth, and unyielding separation and inequality. It baptized the modern American city in blood. As Germany, Italy and other nations whose destiny took a turn for the worse after 1919 demonstrated, “modern” could and did mean the opposite of “progressive.”<br><br>Commemorating the riot 100 years on, in the middle of another moment of racial tumult, requires more than sober acknowledgment of memories and losses. It also requires squarely facing its legacies, which have done so much to thwart progress toward true democracy as well as full equality, and leave us today at risk of falling ever further from these ideals.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) was located when the U.S. Capitol building was stormed by rioters on January 6. According to an Instagram video posted by Ocasio-Cortez just days after the siege, she stated that she was in her office when the U.S. Capitol building was stormed. She also claimed that rioters had entered her office, according to Newsweek. “I had a very close encounter, where I thought I was going to die.”<br><br>“And so I run back into my office,” she said during the video. “I slam my door.

1,16,24,https://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/1004057,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/magazine/ice-surveillance-deportation.html,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/americas-failure-to-protect-its-children-from-school-shootings-is-a-national-disgrace-parkland-florida,"The Washington Post on Sunday released audio of a Saturday phone call between President Donald Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger in which the two can be heard discussing election results. The Post initially released snippets of the hour-long call in which Trump can be heard discussing election results with Raffensperger and his lawyer Ryan Germany. Also joining the call was White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Trump campaign lawyer Cleta Mitchell. Trump lays out numerous examples of double voting, dead people voting, and other ballot irregularities and anomalies. Raffensperger and Germany counter Trump's assertions largely with simple claims that the matters Trump raised have been investigated. Trump insists he won Georgia's presidential election on Nov. 3 and claims widespread fraud deprived him of that victory. The Washington Post claimed that in his talk with Raffensperger, Trump ""repeatedly urged him to alter the outcome of the presidential vote in the state."" This claim is false. The transcript of the call shows Trump demanding an honest accounting of the ballots, which he says would give him more than 11,000 votes. Several key excerpts of the conversation follow. Trump Lays Out Ballot Fraud, Irregularities:<br><br>But we've had hundreds of thousands of ballots that we're able to actually — we'll get you a pretty accurate number. You don't need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands, who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn't vote, were told they couldn't vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that's very, very, very, very sad. We had, I believe it's about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren't on the voter registration list, so it's 4,502 who voted, but they weren't on the voter registration roll, which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant, and they're not allowed to be counted. That's 18,325. Smaller number — you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O. — a post office box number — and they had a post office box number, and that's not allowed. Trump Says Fulton County Videotape Shows Massive Fraud:<br><br>We had at least 18,000 — that's on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly — 18,000 voters having to do with [name]. She's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler [name]. That was the [Fulton County] tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else. Where they got — number one they said very clearly and it's been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back, [name] and her daughter and a few people. There were no Republican poll watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats, either, and there was no law enforcement. Late in the morning, early in the morning, they went to the table with the black robe and the black shield, and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before — the table was put there — I think it was, Brad, you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before, and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren't in an official voter box; they were in what looked to be suitcases or trunks, suitcases, but they weren't in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it, and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion, and it was magnified many times over, and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden. Trump Cites More Examples of Fraud:<br><br>You had out-of-state voters. They voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state, of 4,925. You had absentee ballots sent to vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses, that's 2,326. And you had dropboxes, which is very bad. You had dropboxes that were picked up. We have photographs, and we have affidavits from many people. I don't know if you saw the hearings, but you have dropboxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box, including, you know, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions, and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by — we had vast, I mean the state is in turmoil over this. Trump: Says Many Dead People Voted:<br><br>The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted, and I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number, and a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters. The bottom line is, when you add it all up and then you start adding, you know, 300,000 fake ballots. Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas. And this may or may not be true . . . this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding, shredding ballots and removing equipment. . . . And they supposedly shredded I think they said 300 pounds of, 3,000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it is a very sad situation. But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers where many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified, or they will be certified, but they are certified. And those are numbers that are there, that exist. And that beat the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot, and people should be happy to have an accurate count instead of an election where there's turmoil. Trump Sees Fraud Also in Michigan, Pennsylvania:<br><br>I mean there's turmoil in Georgia and other places. You're not the only one, I mean, we have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. And this is something that — you know, as an example, I think it in Detroit, I think there's a section, a good section of your state actually, which we're not sure so we're not going to report it yet. But in Detroit, we had, I think it was, 139 percent of the people voted. That's not too good. In Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn't play too well, and the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had as an example, in Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted. I think it was, I think, Mark, it was 18,000. Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours, you were in the 4-5,000 category. Raffensperger Claims Only 2 Dead People Voted:<br><br>Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen, and they were surprised. But they — I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two. Two. Two people that were dead that voted. So that's wrong. Raffensperger Claims Video Did Not Show Fraud:<br><br>You're talking about the State Farm video. And I think it's extremely unfortunate that Rudy Giuliani or his people, they sliced and diced that video and took it out of context. The next day, we brought in WSB-TV, and we let them show, see the full run of tape, and what you'll see, the events that transpired are nowhere near what was projected by, you know —<br><br>Trump Disputes Raffensperger:<br><br>But where were the poll watchers, Brad? There were no poll watchers there. There were no Democrats or Republicans. There was no security there. It was late in the evening, late in the, early in the morning, and there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watchers, and why did they say a water main broke, which they did and which was reported in the newspapers? They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break, and there was no water main. There was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But we're, if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where were the Democrat pollwatchers, because there were none. And then you say, well, they left their station, you know, if you look at the tape, and this was, this was reviewed by professional police and detectives and other people, when they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station. When they came back, they didn't go to their station. They went to the apron, wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those. They went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn't do even that because that's illegal, because they had no Republican poll watchers. And remember, her reputation is — she's known all over the Internet, Brad. She's known all over. I'm telling you, ""Where's [name] "" was one of the hot items . . . [name] They knew her. ""Where's [name]?"" So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I, you know, I give everybody the benefit of the doubt. But that was — and Brad, why did they put the votes in three times? You know, they put 'em in three times. Raffensperger Disputes:<br><br>Mr. President, they did not put that. We did an audit of that, and we proved conclusively that they were not scanned three times. Trump Demands to Know:<br><br>Where was everybody else at that late time in the morning? Where was everybody? Where were the Republicans? Where were the security guards? Were the people that were there just a little while before when everyone ran out of the room. How come we had no security in the room. Why did they run to the bottom of the table? Why do they run there and just open the skirt and rip out the votes. I mean, Brad. And they were sitting there, I think for five hours or something like that, the votes. Raffensperger Dismisses the Question:<br><br>Mr. President, we'll send you the link from WSB. Trump Says No Signature Verification:<br><br>No, no you don't [Brad]. No, no you don't. You don't have. Not even close. You're off by hundreds of thousands of votes. And just on the small numbers, you're off on these numbers, and these numbers can't be just — well, why wont? — Okay. So you sent us into Cobb County for signature verification, right? You sent us into Cobb County, which we didn't want to go into. And you said it would be open to the public. So we had our experts there, they weren't allowed into the room. But we didn't want Cobb County. We wanted Fulton County. And you wouldn't give it to us. Now, why aren't we doing signature — and why can't it be open to the public? And why can't we have professionals do it instead of rank amateurs who will never find anything and don't want to find anything? They don't want to find, you know they don't want to find anything. Someday you'll tell me the reason why, because I don't understand your reasoning, but someday you'll tell me the reason why. But why don't you want to find? Trump Says 100% of Military Ballots Go for Biden:<br><br>And what about that batch of military ballots that came in. And even though I won the military by a lot, it was 100 percent Trump. I mean 100 percent Biden. Do you know about that? A large group of ballots came in, I think it was to Fulton County, and they just happened to be 100 percent for Trump — for Biden — even though Trump won the military by a lot, you know, a tremendous amount. But these ballots were 100 percent for Biden. And do you know about that? A very substantial number came in, all for Biden. Does anybody know about it? . . . Okay, Cleta, I'm not asking you, Cleta, honestly. I'm asking Brad. Do you know about the military ballots that we have confirmed now. Do you know about the military ballots that came in that were 100 percent, I mean 100 percent, for Biden. Do you know about that? Raffensperger Attorney Germany Responds:<br><br>I don't know about that. I do know that we have, when military ballots come in, it's not just military, it's also military and overseas citizens. The military part of that does generally go Republican. The overseas citizen part of it generally goes very Democrat. This was a mix of 'em. Trump Continues:<br><br>No, but this was. That's okay. But I got like 78 percent of the military. These ballots were all for . . . They didn't tell me overseas. Could be overseas, too, but I get votes overseas, too, Ryan, in all fairness. No they came in, a large batch came in, and it was, quote, 100 percent for Biden. And that is criminal. You know, that's criminal. Okay. That's another criminal, that's another of the many criminal events, many criminal events here. I don't know, look, Brad. I got to get . . . I have to find 12,000 votes, and I have them times a lot. And therefore, I won the state. That's before we go to the next step, which is in the process of right now. You know, and I watched you this morning, and you said, well, there was no criminality. But I mean all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. When you talk about no criminality, I think it's very dangerous for you to say that. Trump: I Only Need 11,000 Votes<br><br>So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break. You know, we have that in spades already. Or we can keep it going, but that's not fair to the voters of Georgia because they're going to see what happened, and they're going to see what happened. I mean, I'll, I'll take on anybody you want with regard to [name] and her lovely daughter, a very lovely young lady, I'm sure. But, but [name] . . . I will take on anybody you want. And the minimum, there were 18,000 ballots, but they used them three times. So that's, you know, a lot of votes. And they were all to Biden, by the way, that's the other thing we didn't say. You know, [name] , the one thing I forgot to say, which was the most important. You know that every single ballot she did went to Biden. You know that, right? Do you know that, by the way, Brad? Every single ballot that she did through the machines at early, early in the morning went to Biden. Did you know that, Ryan? Germany Responds:<br><br>That's not accurate, Mr. President. . . . The numbers that we are showing are accurate. © 2022 Newsmax.

An ICE officer in an Oregon parking lot before making an arrest in the predawn hours.Credit...Matt Black/Magnum, for The New York Times<br><br>The winter after Donald Trump was elected president, strangers began appearing in a parking lot on southern Washington State’s Long Beach Peninsula, at the port where the oyster boats come and go. Rather than gaze at the bay or the boats or the building-size piles of bleached shells, two men — one thinner, one thicker — stared at the shellfish workers. The strangers sat in their vehicle and watched the workers arrive in their trucks. They watched the workers grab their gear and walk to the docks. The workers watched them watching, too, and they soon began to realize that the men were from Immigration and Customs Enforcement. When the workers made eye contact, the officers nodded politely, but they said very little. For weeks, they just watched. Then the workers began to vanish. The officers got someone at a restaurant in the town of Long Beach. They got someone else in a predawn takedown at the port. They arrested a man early one morning in nearby Ocean Park and spent the rest of that day looking for another in the town of Chinook. Then, another day, they went back to the port for another morning arrest. The men from ICE made courtesy phone calls to the local authorities at the Pacific County Sheriff’s Office before making arrests, and local A.C.L.U. volunteers later obtained recordings of the calls, so it is possible to reconstruct the officers’ growing familiarity with the peninsula and its residents. “Yes, ma’am,” the thinner one said, in a call recorded that January. “My name is Officer Lonnie Miller with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. We’re going to be conducting an arrest out in the Nahcotta boat basin area this morning.”<br><br>The sheriff’s dispatcher sounded confused. “In where?” she asked. “Nik-oda? Nik-otta? Near Ocean Park,” Officer Miller said, trying different pronunciations. The site was named after an 1800s Chinook leader who had been friendly with the white settlers. “Nuh-caught-uh,” the dispatcher said, gently correcting him. The officer continued to struggle in February. “The Nikoda … Nicotta tidelands area,” he said in one call. “The Nikoda boat basin … Nahcotta. I’m probably pronouncing it incorrectly.”<br><br>But as spring turned to summer, Miller was learning to talk like a local — “I don’t have a specific address, but it’s the Port of Peninsula, um, up in Nahcotta” — and he and his partner, a deportation officer named M. Curtis Dietz, were turning their attention to the inland neighborhoods of the peninsula, where the workers lived with their families. Miller and Dietz could drive from the port to Ocean Park, a village of 1,600 people, in about five minutes. Much of the drive took them along Bay Avenue, a broad thoroughfare that cuts across the two-mile-wide peninsula, connecting the shallow, oyster-rich waters of Willapa Bay on the east side to the thundering surf of the Pacific Ocean on the west side. Small businesses flank the avenue: a hardware store, a bank, a taco stand, a grocery store called Okie’s, a restaurant catering to the retirees who have settled here in beach cabins and Cape Cod-style homes. Eventually the officers began spending more time around 1925 Bay Avenue, an apartment complex and trailer park known as Tijuanita. They lurked in a revolving fleet of unmarked vehicles — a blue Hyundai S.U.V., a gold Ford Taurus X, a muscle car residents remember as a Ford Mustang — outfitted with aftermarket flashing light bars. Twice in April and twice more in June, Miller called the sheriff’s dispatcher to say they were parked just outside the trailer park, conducting surveillance. The officers were looking for people, and seemingly for specific people. For the peninsula’s Spanish-speaking families, this fact led to some urgent questions. How were the officers picking their targets? And how did they find them? To arrest someone, ICE had to know who was who, and who was undocumented, and who lived where, and who drove what — but how could its officers know all this? As families waited for answers, they hid more often in their homes, drawing the blinds, skipping volleyball games and birthday parties. But life went on. In early June from the safety of one of the Tijuanita apartments, a woman named Gladys Díaz Tadeo, the mother of three young daughters, posted a photo on Facebook of her family’s latest art project, a smiling piñata in the shape of a cupcake, which her proud 4-year-old struggled to hold up for the camera. Comments came pouring in. “Que bonitas,” wrote one neighbor. “Do you make them yourself?”<br><br>Díaz’s sister Maria answered for her, “Yes, she makes them 🙂 she made me this,” and shared images of other piñatas Díaz made, including a perfect rendition of the Dalmatian puppy from the cartoon “Paw Patrol.”<br><br>The cupcake was for sale — $20 — but there was no immediate buyer, and Díaz’s post, visible only to the roughly 10,000 other members of Chinookville, a private buy/sell Facebook group for the region, soon moved down the feed. It is very likely that Díaz was already a target when she posted the piñata, very likely that ICE already knew her full name and address and license-plate number and social-media handles, had mapped out her family members’ names, their social-media handles. When not in the field, Miller, Dietz and their colleagues spent long days at their computers at the ICE office in Portland, Ore., two hours from the peninsula, gathering intelligence and building target lists, some for daily operations, some for nationwide raids like those Trump repeatedly advertised last summer. Because Díaz had been caught a decade earlier trying to enter the country with a fake green card — she successfully slipped in the next day — she would have been marked as a priority for deportation. On June 23, Miller and Dietz woke before dawn, as they frequently did, and began driving north up the peninsula, possibly from the tourist town of Long Beach, where they often overnighted at the Best Western. The air was still that morning, and the spring rains had finally stopped, and by the time the officers pulled off the road near Tijuanita, the sun was coming up. They began watching cars go by. One of the first to pass, a white pickup on its way to the port, was driven by Díaz’s longtime boyfriend and the American-born girls’ father, Baltazar Aburto Gutierrez, who is better known as Rosas. He recognized the officers and waved to them out the window — an act of quiet defiance. They waved back, Rosas says. For most of the next few hours, according to the sheriff’s dispatch records, Miller and Dietz kept sitting there. At 9:57 a.m., Miller called in to say they were clearing out. As apparently happened in April and again earlier in June, they were leaving empty-handed. But then, 18 minutes later, he called back. “Sorry to keep bothering you guys,” he said, chuckling apologetically. “That’s O.K.,” the dispatcher replied. “We’re headed back up to Ocean Park,” he said. “We think our person is going to be heading over to the Bank of the Pacific.”<br><br>When Rosas returned home, a little after 10 a.m., he found Díaz loading the piñata — and their daughters — into her car. Someone on Facebook had just responded to her ad. It was a person using a Hispanic name who didn’t seem to speak much Spanish, someone she’d never met whose profile picture was of a dog. (When she tried to find the page again a few weeks later, it was gone.) She was meeting the person next to Okie’s at Bank of the Pacific. “Why don’t they just come here?” Rosas asked her. “Gladys, wait, don’t go,” he yelled after her as she drove off, but maybe she didn’t hear him. Miller and Dietz were waiting when Díaz pulled up to the bank. “Are you Gladys Díaz?” one asked. They showed her a printout they had somehow obtained of her Washington State driver’s license. Her girls began to cry. “I don’t want them to take you!” the oldest screamed. Díaz tried to calm her. “You don’t need to get upset,” she whispered. “It’s nothing. Let’s see what happens.”<br><br>Some peninsula residents arrested by ICE got to pay a bond — $10,000, $15,000, maybe $20,000 — and were released back into the community as they waited months or years for their day in immigration court. But Díaz, with a previous deportation on her record, would not be one of them. The officers handcuffed her, and 24 hours later, Díaz was in a private detention center near Seattle. Three weeks later, she was deported to Mexico, where she began bouncing among relatives’ homes in her native Jalisco, separated by 2,600 miles from her daughters. 2. ‘Felons, not families’<br><br>The business of deportation, like so much else in the modern world, has been transformed by the power of big data. There are 10.5 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, according to the Pew Research Center, but there are only about 6,100 officers in ICE’s Enforcement and Removal Operations (E.R.O.) division. (The roughly equivalent number of special agents in ICE’s other main division, Homeland Security Investigations, or H.S.I., have historically focused on transnational crime rather than immigration violations per se, though this is changing.) There are 50 states for ICE to cover, as well as Washington and U.S. territories like Puerto Rico, more than 3.8 million square miles. There are continuing staffing shortages at the agency, where job satisfaction, while on the rise under Trump, remains notably low. And there is relentless pressure from the White House to deport people. So ICE tries to find efficiencies where it can, and it uses technology — some of it built for consumers, some of it built for spies or the police — to do more with less. A spokeswoman for the agency said it would not comment on its investigative techniques, and the agency has declined to respond to many questions for this article. But public records make clear that ICE, like other federal agencies, sucks up terabytes of information from hundreds of disparate computer systems, from state and local governments, from private data brokers and from social networks. It piggybacks on software and sharing agreements originally meant for criminal and counterterrorism investigators, fusing little bits of stray information together into dossiers. The work is regulated by only a set of outdated privacy laws and the limits of the technology. [What happens after an ICE raid? Read more about the deportation process.] Tracking immigrants in this country is an increasingly trivial exercise because it’s an increasingly trivial exercise to track any of us. The same phenomenon helped make the reporting for this article possible: Over the course of more than a year, I tried to reverse-engineer individual ICE officers’ use of America’s vast post-Sept. 11 domestic-surveillance apparatus, retracing their hunt for targets down to the very searches they entered into their computers. Based on hundreds of government-procurement records, dozens of interviews and thousands of pages of documents I and others obtained via public-records requests, the account that follows reveals new evidence of surveillance of detainees’ voice and video calls at ICE facilities and extensive proof that the agency relies on state D.M.V. databases and information products like CLEAR, from Thomson Reuters, to target immigrants. It shows how the Real ID Act of 2005, along with funding from the Department of Homeland Security (D.H.S.) and help from umbrella groups like the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators (A.A.M.V.A. ), has laid the groundwork for real-time, real-world monitoring of American residents. It’s still a partial view. But it’s enough to show the scale of the machine. ICE’s transformation began under President Barack Obama. Criticized by activists as the “deporter in chief,” Obama indeed removed more than three million people from the country, including, in 2013, what remains the annual record — 432,448 people. But part of the spike he oversaw was an accounting trick: Near the Southern border, migrants caught trying to cross were increasingly subject to formal removal proceedings (and thus officially counted in statistics), a change from previous administrations. Away from the border, Obama tried to shift ICE’s priorities. He curtailed the agency’s longstanding practice of workplace raids, and active pursuit was now largely limited, especially during his second term, to convicted criminals, suspected gang members or terrorists and people apprehended at the border. The administration also discouraged so-called collateral arrests, in which ICE came looking for one person and instead nabbed a neighbor or a co-worker. The lowest priority were long-term residents with American children or spouses. “Felons, not families,” Obama explained in a 2014 speech. “Criminals, not children. Gang members, not a mom who is working hard to provide for her kids.”<br><br>ICE now needed systems that could more intelligently parse priority targets from the general population of millions of undocumented immigrants. Under Obama, the agency signed several key data and analytics contracts that have since drawn controversy, including with Thomson Reuters, the Silicon Valley firm Palantir and the Beltway start-up Giant Oak, and it relied ever more on local-federal data-sharing initiatives that flourished after Sept. 11. Information that was once siloed or tedious to access — driver’s-license photos, phone records, jail bookings — was increasingly at deportation officers’ fingertips. One of Trump’s first acts as president was to throw out his predecessor’s priority list. He issued Executive Order 13768, “Enhancing Public Safety in the Interior of the United States,” on his sixth day in office. “We cannot faithfully execute the immigration laws of the United States,” the order reads, “if we exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement.” Data once used to focus on prioritized groups could now, in theory, be used against anyone, and individual officers now had a freer hand to pursue their own priorities. The results were predictable: Both the percentage and sheer number of arrests by ICE of people without criminal convictions shot upward. There were 58,010 such arrests during the administration’s first 14 months, according to an analysis by NBC News — nearly three times as many as during the preceding 14 months. Statistics compiled by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, meanwhile, show a significant rise in immigration cases involving long-term residents. In an interview before her retirement this year, Elizabeth Godfrey, ICE’s acting field office director for the Pacific Northwest region, pointed to another reason the profile of its arrestees had changed: A series of pre-Trump court decisions, notably one made by a federal judge in Oregon in 2014, led a growing number of jails across the country to stop honoring ICE requests that they notify the agency of pending releases or hold immigrants beyond their scheduled release dates. This, together with sanctuary policies in a growing number of jurisdictions, cut off deportation officers’ easiest source of arrests, driving them to new hunting grounds. Officers working out of Godfrey’s Portland office — which was shut down for more than a week by protests last year — still carefully prioritized their targets, she said. They studied them in advance. Before attempting an arrest, they completed a form, the Field Operations Worksheet, and had it approved by two layers of supervisors. When given a choice, they would always pursue someone with a serious criminal history rather than someone without. But that wasn’t always the choice. Targeting decisions also depend on who’s findable. And today who’s findable depends on who has left a trail for officers to follow: people with driver’s licenses, people with car insurance, people with utility bills, people who pay U.S. taxes, people with social-media accounts, people with stable homes, people with American-born children, people who live American lives, people who once thought — if only for a moment — that they weren’t on the list. “We still have a job to do,” Godfrey told me. “We still have a mandate. So where are we going to locate these people? At a place of employment or at their home or anywhere else we can find them.”<br><br>3. ‘They knew who I was.’<br><br>The first person outside Pacific County’s Mexican community to notice the ICE crackdown was Erin Glenn, a soft-spoken high school teacher whose family has lived and farmed in the area for five generations. In 2015, after years of little noticeable ICE activity, a man she’d known for decades was suddenly picked up and deported. At first Glenn, who studied Spanish in college and later taught English to recent immigrants, let doubts creep in. “It’s the feds,” she says. “I thought they must know something about him I didn’t.” But the next year, as Trump campaigned and soon won the presidency on promises to clamp down on immigration, ICE arrested at least eight more of Glenn’s neighbors and friends, and she saw a trend. She began to privately tally the names of the people who had disappeared. The arrests seemed to accelerate, and the list became more detailed: how people were taken, where they were taken, when they were taken and whom they left behind. In March 2017, Glenn attended a community meeting to tell her fellow residents about the disappearances in their midst. “I have the names,” she declared. “I created a spreadsheet. It’s real.” The group — a few dozen people organizing under the banners of Living Liberally and A.C.L.U. People Power, most of them white and female, many of them retirees — decided to do something about it. They raised money to help pay legal fees for the newly detained and buy food and pay rent for the families left behind, eventually forming their own nonprofit, Pacific County Immigrant Support. According to Glenn’s tally, Gladys Díaz was ICE’s 22nd local arrest. She was the second woman. She was the first mother of young children. In the tense days that followed, Glenn made a phone call to an old friend, Sydney Stevens. Stevens lives up the peninsula in Oysterville, a tiny village founded in part by her great-grandfather, in a stately 1869 house overlooking Willapa Bay. A teacher for 41 years, she is a local historian and the author of 19 books on the area’s settlers, tribes, farms and railroad. She writes a popular blog and has a column in the regional newspaper, The Chinook Observer. She has a platform, and Glenn, who in normal times tends toward privacy, desperately wanted a platform. “You need to do something,” she told Stevens. Over lunch the next day, Glenn and Stevens developed a plan: Glenn would make introductions and serve as translator as Stevens wrote a series of profiles for The Chinook Observer of the people taken and the families who remained. Their first visit was to Gladys Díaz’s sister Maria, who in Stevens’s description was slight and young, “all eyes,” and was holding her 2-year-old son when she opened the door. Three months had passed since her husband, Miguel, was arrested, and now ICE had Gladys too. Maria was preparing paperwork and selling off their possessions so she and their children, who were U.S. citizens, could join Miguel in Mexico. She worried ICE would arrest her before they could depart on their own. “I am afraid every day,” she told Stevens. She met the ICE officers who arrested him, she said. It was Miguel’s payday, and they took him home before driving him to detention so he could deliver his family a last paycheck. They were polite, she said. She told Glenn and Stevens a variation of what they would hear time and again in their interviews: “They knew who I was.”<br><br>How ICE knew what it knew remained a subject of great debate on the peninsula. Washington is one of 14 states that allow undocumented people to obtain driver’s licenses, and some Pacific County residents suspected that an employee at the Department of Licensing (D.O.L.) office in the town of Ilwaco, a man who always asked lots of questions when immigrants came in, was the mole. (A D.O.L. spokeswoman said that such behavior would be a violation of departmental policies and that the agency had no evidence of it occurring.) Others suspected that ICE received help from the sheriff’s office or the Long Beach police, contrary to the spirit of Washington State’s sanctuary policy. The People Power activists filed public-records requests, but the files that came back, including the sheriff’s emails and audio of Officer Miller’s courtesy calls to dispatch, suggested that local authorities were largely in the dark. The continuing mystery left everyone spooked. One activist told me about a police car parked near her house after she filed a records request. A woman whose family members were undocumented said she heard clicking sounds on her cellphone, and she was careful about what she said in case the calls were being monitored. Glenn’s son has a Hispanic first name — his father was born in Mexico — and now she sometimes caught herself wondering if she should have named him something else. One rainy night, the two of them were driving home after dark in her weathered S.U.V., and the headlights behind her seemed to follow her every turn. She pulled on to a side street, and the car behind her did, too, and she returned to the main road, and it did, too, so she and her son went instead to her parents’ place, where she parked in the driveway with her heart pounding. They stayed the night. The creeping paranoia sometimes seemed ridiculous to her, and sometimes it didn’t — because people kept vanishing. “One moment they’re living life,” Glenn told me, “and then they’re gone, their car just sitting on the side of the road. It feels like a death.”<br><br>The third of the 14 profiles Stevens wrote for The Chinook Observer, a series called “Stories from the Heart” that would go on to help the paper win statewide journalism honors, featured Rosas and his girls waiting at home while Díaz sat in the detention center. The ICE officers had walked the family back to the apartment to return the girls to Rosas. “Why don’t you just take all of us?” he recalled saying to them, when we later spoke. “Why don’t you take me and leave Gladys? Why did you do this in front of my girls?” He remembered one of the officers — Miller and Dietz are both known to show detainees small acts of kindness, like loosening handcuffs that aren’t actually that tight — saying he was sorry. “I’m sorrier,” Rosas said. Neither deportation officer would speak with me when I called their cellphones — Dietz did stay on the line long enough to ask how I had his private number, which I obtained from a data broker — but Dietz detailed the encounter with Rosas in a written report. The subject “appeared visibly nervous,” he wrote. “It was clear that his native language is Spanish.” He noted that Rosas had asked to be taken instead, indicating that Rosas, too, was undocumented. But “ICE deportation officers did not arrest him at that time due to humanitarian reasons,” an agency spokeswoman explained in a statement, “so he could care for family members.”<br><br>In a December 2017 internal email recently obtained by the rights groups Detention Watch Network and Mijente, Matthew Albence, then the head of E.R.O. and now ICE’s newest acting director, gave a blunter version of the same explanation. His agency had just been contacted by the office of Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, who wanted to discuss the case of Díaz and Rosas. “The mother was a fugitive and was being arrested,” Albence wrote to members of his staff. “We could’ve arrested the man at the time and left the children as wards of the state — I don’t think that’s a practice the governor would like us to start.”<br><br>4. ‘Hot lists’<br><br>The first evidence that ICE’s data harvesting relied on something other than a rogue Department of Licensing employee was an explosive Seattle Times article in early 2018. Brad Benfield, an assistant director at D.O.L., confirmed to the reporter Nina Shapiro that when deportation officers emailed the department’s fraud unit to inquire about a target, the unit gave them whatever it had: photos and even, crucially, driver’s-license application forms — which included key details like place of birth and whether, for instance, a Mexican passport had been used to prove identity. In hundreds of partly redacted emails I acquired from the department, including its correspondence with Officers Miller and Dietz, fraud-unit employees seem harried as they field dozens of queries a day from a variety of federal and state agencies. “Here is your request,” one writes over and over. “Here is your request.” “Here is your request.” “Here is your request.”<br><br>Inslee effectively made Washington a sanctuary state in February 2017 in response to Trump’s Executive Order 13768. But now, a year later, one of his own agencies was revealed to be feeding information to ICE. The Seattle Times article caused a local uproar. One top D.O.L. official immediately resigned, and the department’s longtime director soon followed. But the emails to and from the fraud unit, my reporting shows, were just the beginning: ICE also had a direct line to D.O.L.’s main database. Using a computer interface known as Driver and Plate Search, or DAPS, Miller, Dietz and dozens of other immigration officers ran tens of thousands of searches before D.O.L., facing pressure from rights groups, journalists and the governor’s office, cut off their access last year. The department opened up DAPS to outside users after Sept. 11 to replace the human team it had kept on call 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to field queries from the police and federal agencies. Now investigators could log in and run their own searches. The system’s modern interface and flexible search — for partial plate numbers, for street addresses without an exact house number, for phonetic matches to a name — appears to have made it a favorite over older systems such as Nlets, originally known as the National Law Enforcement Teletype System, a network shared by 45,000 agencies in the United States and Canada. By the time people started disappearing from the Long Beach Peninsula, F.B.I. officers had accounts, and federal marshals had accounts, and local sheriffs had accounts, and ICE officers used it again and again, nearly every day at all times of day. According to search logs I obtained through public-records requests, deportation officers covering Pacific County and the rest of western Washington ran at least 102,769 queries through the system in 2016 and 2017, most of them after Trump took office, including 9,747 in the first two months of his presidency: 5,415 for names and 4,332 for plates. One unidentified ICE employee even logged in at 2:34 a.m. on New Year’s Day 2017, spending the next hour running searches on six plates and 11 names. Officers Miller and Dietz, whose beat also includes parts of Oregon — which DAPS doesn’t cover — used the system regularly in 2017. Together they searched it 4,542 times. They searched it 67 times in the 24 hours before Gladys Díaz was arrested. Roughly half of their searches in 2017 were for names, not plates, implying that they already knew whom they were looking for and simply needed an address or other information. But many days, perhaps the days the officers sat at the side of the road and watched traffic pass, perhaps the days they cruised parking lots outside restaurants or seafood processors or apartment buildings, perhaps the days they saw drivers they decided looked foreign, the searches followed the telltale pattern of a fishing expedition: plate, plate, plate, plate, plate, plate, plate, plate. Under Trump, the fishing has only become easier. In December 2017, as first reported by the technology website The Verge, ICE gained long-sought access to the world’s largest privately run database of license-plate scans — more than five billion historic images captured continually and automatically, thousands per minute, by infrared devices attached to lampposts and police cars and repossession-agent vehicles across the United States. Plates are scannable because D.M.V.s now design them that way: In a 2012 A.A.M.V.A. best-practices guide partly funded by ICE’s sister agency within D.H.S., Customs and Border Protection (C.B.P. ), A.A.M.V.A. advises its members to use opaque inks and “retro-reflective” surfaces and to always keep letters and numbers away from any bolt holes that could confound the machines. The database ICE uses is run by Vigilant Solutions, a California company recently acquired by Motorola that has agreements with more than a thousand law-enforcement agencies nationwide. ICE’s roughly $200,000-a-month contract — a previous version was batted down over privacy concerns during the Obama administration — lets deportation officers map immigrants’ daily rhythms with true granularity. Now they can see precisely when and where vehicles of interest have been spotted during the previous five years, and they can upload 2,500-plate “hot lists” that trigger immediate iPhone alerts whenever a target is scanned by a camera in the network. As computer vision improves, ICE has become interested in another D.M.V. data trove: digital images of our faces. Washington, like nearly all states, is now using facial-recognition software to find duplicate driver’s licenses and root out identity fraud — a technological leap made possible by D.H.S. funding, A.A.M.V.A. guidelines and a provision in 2005’s controversial Real ID Act that requires license photos to be digital and thus easily stored and shared. Internal D.O.L. records, reported here for the first time, show that until January 2018, the department repeatedly fed the resulting instances of what it determined by an investigation to be fraud to ICE and other federal agencies — including one partly redacted file, titled Facial Recognition Spreadsheet III, that may contain the name of someone in Pacific County. In early July 2019, as first reported by The Washington Post, Georgetown University’s Center on Privacy & Technology released documents revealing that at least two more states (Utah and Vermont) have run face searches against their driver’s-license databases on behalf of ICE. There are surely others: A.A.M.V.A. offered facial-recognition guidelines to its members — every D.M.V. in the country — in 2015. “One of the benefits of using a facial image as the biometric,” it argued, “is that unlike a fingerprint, acquisition of the biometric image is unobtrusive.” Surveillance works best when you don’t notice it. In Pacific County, Erin Glenn and Sydney Stevens worried that they had revealed Rosas’ identity to ICE by printing his first name and nickname in The Chinook Observer. But Rosas had registered and insured his white truck under his own name, following the law, and he had a legal Washington driver’s license. By the time Stevens published the interview, Miller and Dietz had run the truck’s plate through DAPS at least seven times. 5. ‘A veneer of objectivity’<br><br>If the recurring fear in Pacific County was that some unknown person — the sheriff, a local informant — was secretly behind ICE’s arrests, the recurring fear among rights groups in the other Washington, in the District of Columbia, was quite the opposite: that immigration decisions would soon be so automated as to effectively cut humans out of the loop. Exhibit A as the new administration took control of the capital was the Extreme Vetting Initiative. The initiative was ICE’s attempt to bring an ill-defined Trump campaign promise to life using artificial intelligence. The agency introduced it in a July 2017 “industry day” in a Marriott conference room near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, inviting a flock of technology firms and Beltway contractors. The event’s host was the Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation Unit (C.T.C.E.U. ), an office within H.S.I. that scrutinizes visa applicants and visa holders before and after they arrive in the United States. The guests, according to a sign-in sheet obtained by The Intercept, were a parade of billion-dollar companies — Thomson Reuters, LexisNexis, IBM, Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte, PricewaterhouseCoopers — along with various smaller newcomers, including the social-media monitoring start-ups Giant Oak and Babel Street. To build the system it wanted, ICE expected to award one or some of them a contract worth $100 million or more. Interest was so high that the Marriott event, originally planned for one day, had to stretch to two. The goal of the Extreme Vetting Initiative was “determinations via automation,” ICE explained to the attendees. It sought partners whose algorithms could scan social media and other publicly available information and assess whether an immigrant was likely to become a “positively contributing member of society” — or whether he or she intended “to commit criminal or terrorist attacks.” Written text would be analyzed for sentiment, Facebook posts for aberrant thoughts, emojis for signs of criminality. The system would replace C.T.C.E.U.’s human analysts and “generate a minimum of 10,000 investigative leads annually.”<br><br>In early 2018, ICE seemed to retreat from the Extreme Vetting Initiative, which has since been renamed the Visa Lifecycle Vetting Initiative. The contract, for $102 million, went to CSRA, a Beltway giant already doing work for ICE that has since been purchased by General Dynamics. The company employed more than 100 human analysts — ensuring that people would still be firmly in charge of vetting other people. But the retreat, procurement documents show, was partial at best: H.S.I. had already been testing automated social-media profiling under Obama, and many of the technology companies that showed up at ICE’s Marriott event were already working for it. In 2016, ICE paid a broadband provider $50,400 “to strengthen C.T.C.E.U.’s open-source social-media exploitation capabilities as well as future growth by adding fiber-optic internet.” For the social-media capabilities themselves, it paid $1.4 million that year — and has since paid millions more — to Giant Oak, a rapidly expanding, 30-person analytics firm in Virginia that was founded by the behavioral economist and former C.B.P. chief of staff Gary Shiffman. One of Giant Oak’s early contracts was for a DARPA “quantitative counterinsurgency” project in Afghanistan. Two years ago, Forbes reported on the company’s work with ICE and detailed its flagship product, GOST, short for Giant Oak Search Technology, which allows users to search the dark web and social media to create “a dossier on each individual with everything you need to know, such as web page images and keywords already highlighted.”<br><br>When I met Shiffman in a pub in Georgetown last year, he confirmed that the company worked for H.S.I., vetting visa holders and visa applicants, but not for E.R.O. Its technology wasn’t in the hands of domestic deportation officers like Miller and Dietz. He made clear that he didn’t want to live in a country that indiscriminately rounded up foreigners. But if public safety was the goal, the answer wasn’t to stop scanning people’s data. It was to do it the right way. “Now this is my theory,” he told me, “and you tell me if it’s crazy or wrong. But I think that the better we have entity resolution” — that is, the better we can compile and measure people’s data — “the less of a surveillance state we’ll have.” Once the machine is perfect, as long as you’re following the rules, you won’t even have to know it’s there. 6. ‘So we ended up arresting him.’<br><br>A week after ICE’s Extreme Vetting Initiative event, computers delivered what could be considered a new kind of collateral arrest to Pacific County. Mario Rodríguez, a bilingual teaching aide in the local schools, matched none of the agency’s stated enforcement priorities, even under Trump. He appeared on ICE’s radar earlier that summer, Miller wrote in his arrest report. The two deportation officers had been “conducting an investigation into a separate individual at his apartment complex,” and they used DAPS to run the plates of the vehicles parked in the lot. Three, including a black Jeep, were registered to Rodríguez. Armed with his name, the officers then made a “biographic search of immigration and criminal history databases,” which showed that Rodríguez entered the United States legally on a visa in 2005. A visa overstay is a civil offense, and Rodríguez has no criminal record. But here he was, bird in hand, man in database, so soon after, Miller wrote, “a Field Operations Worksheet was completed,” adding him to their list of targets. Rodríguez is watchful and deliberate and seems younger than his 51 years. A generation of Pacific County students knows him as Maestro Mario, and at the time of his arrest, he was about to return to university to receive his teaching degree, so he could finally have his own classroom. In his former career in Mexico, where he earned a degree in information science, Rodríguez worked various security and public-safety jobs. He had a U.S. visa because he once went on a business trip to Silicon Valley to visit Cisco Systems. He liked what he saw. “I always wanted to come here,” Rodríguez told me. “It was my American dream.”<br><br>Rodríguez is gay. In Mexico, he says, he could not be. During high school, he changed his voice to sound “more like a man” and avoid bullying, and in 2000, fearing he would lose his job if he remained suspiciously single, he married a woman. In 2003, he found out he had H.I.V. — he’d contracted the disease before his marriage — and during a clinic visit, the doctor outed Rodríguez to his wife and declared that he was paying the consequences. To be gay and H.I.V.-positive in Mexico, and dependent on doctors like that for his medication, was untenable, Rodríguez soon decided. So he got on a plane to the United States and cleared customs without incident, and when he arrived on the Long Beach Peninsula, where his brother already lived, he felt welcome. It was a Thursday morning a dozen years later, sometime after 10 a.m., when Rodríguez passed Miller and Dietz in Long Beach on his way to the post office. They recognized his car — “You always keep it so clean!” he says they later told him — and began to follow him. At 10:32, DAPS logs show, Dietz ran his plate again, perhaps just to make sure. When Rodríguez pulled into the post-office parking lot, the two officers did, too. As Rodríguez walked inside, Miller called out his name: “Mario.” Rodríguez smiled and shook the stranger’s hand, and Miller showed him his badge. The officers were friendly enough, Rodríguez says. They let him get his meds from the back seat, where he’d been keeping a month’s supply in case of emergency, such as if ICE came for him. Before they drove him to Portland in handcuffs, periodically making sure he liked the radio station they’d chosen, Miller called the Pacific County Sheriff’s Office. “How’s it going this morning?” he asked the dispatcher. “It’s a-goin’,” she responded. “How’s it going with you?”<br><br>“Good. So, we were driving through Long Beach, and we, um, saw one of our suspects that we were investigating.” He chuckled a bit. “So we ended up arresting him,” he continued. “We usually try to call you guys ahead of time, but it was just one of those things where …”<br><br>The dispatcher started laughing. “He just showed up?” she asked. “Pretty much,” Miller said, and now they laughed together for a moment, sharing in the serendipity of it all. At the ICE field office in Portland, the officers put Rodríguez in a cold room and served him lunch, a burrito. “Who’s going to come get your car from the post office?” he says Miller asked him. “My brother.”<br><br>“Oh, yeah, what’s his name? Where’s he work?”<br><br>Rodríguez began to respond until he realized that this, like so many other interactions that had once seemed normal, was an exercise in data-gathering. “Do I have to answer that?” he asked. For at least four hours, the officers questioned him, most likely entering his answers into a computer application, ENFORCE, that helps feed a data pool of more than 100 million records called the Enforcement Integrated Database. An actuarial tool in the database, the Risk Classification Assessment, uses details gleaned from a detainee’s life — criminal and health history, address, work and family stability, lack of scars or tattoos or previous deportations — to automatically calculate supervision requirements or how much bond he or she should be asked to pay, a decision that would be reviewed by an E.R.O. officer and sometimes an immigration judge. Under Obama, the tool sometimes recommended immediate release for certain people, but under Trump, according to a 2018 Reuters investigation, that option was removed. (An ICE spokesman told Reuters that ICE personnel could still override the tool’s assessment.) When the paperwork was finally done, Rodríguez says, a “rude woman” took over, shuttling him and another detainee, a Guatemalan, into a short white bus with hard plastic seats and bars on its windows. Instead of handcuffs, they had to wear what is known as a three-piece suit: shackles on wrists and ankles, a metal band around the waist and chains connecting them all. Rodríguez says the woman wore a uniform of the Geo Group, a $2 billion publicly traded prison operator whose stock price nearly doubled in the three months after Trump’s election. She drove them three hours north to a 1,575-bed ICE facility then known as the Northwest Detention Center, in a remedied Superfund sludge field in Tacoma, Wash., where Rodríguez would spend most of the next month. He was released, pending an appearance in immigration court, after posting $7,500 at his bond hearing. It was one of the lowest bonds anyone from Pacific County had paid to that point — but it was his savings for the school he was about to attend, and it was almost everything he had. 7. ‘Who is this?’<br><br>The dehumanizing nature of America’s immigrant detention centers is now well documented. At ICE’s Geo-run facility in Tacoma — where Díaz and most of Pacific County’s other arrestees also ended up — there have been hunger strikes to protest the conditions, and at least one lawsuit is pending over underpayment: Detainees working the usual array of prison-style jobs earn $1 a day. Less well documented is how the ICE detention centers are now engineered to subject immigrants to further surveillance. According to promotional materials for one of the companies that provides technology to ICE facilities, these capabilities include software that can not only record and catalog both sides of a conversation but also analyze links between the callers and the recipients. Video and audio calling in ICE facilities is formally provided by an Alabama company called Talton, which holds the federal contract. But the calls run on technology from the San Francisco company Telmate, which licenses to Talton the same platform it sells to hundreds of jails and prisons in America’s criminal-justice system. Telmate is a subsidiary of GTL, a technology firm that American Securities, a private-equity company, picked up for about $1 billion in 2011. It follows a recognizable version of the Silicon Valley business model: Its users — inmates, detainees and their families and friends — get convenience in the form of calls, video chats, voice mail messages, photo sharing and text messaging, while its real clients — prisons and law enforcement — get user data. Telmate’s privacy policy tells inmates and their friends and family members to “assume that all communications will be accessed, reviewed, analyzed, searched, scrutinized, rendered searchable, compiled, assembled, accumulated, stored, used and transferred.” Its web-based surveillance software, which it promotes as free to guards and investigators with every install, includes call-pattern analysis, relationship analysis and tools for data visualization. A spokesman for Telmate said: “We defer to Talton and its customer as to how they configure the licensed technology.” ICE would not comment on its monitoring of detainees’ calls or its officers’ use, if any, of Telmate’s free investigative tools. It likewise declined to comment about any cellphone forensics it may or may not perform, though the agency has options if it wants to scan an immigrant’s phone: As Forbes reported, H.S.I. has paid millions of dollars to two leading phone-hacking companies, Cellebrite and GrayShift. And if it needs to tap a phone line, it may be able to do so: It also has a contract with PenLink, which makes call-interception tools. In Pacific County, many people suspected ICE was interested in their phones. One resident told me she had noticed something unusual when her husband was behind bars in Tacoma, his phone confiscated: He periodically showed up as logged in to Facebook. The oddest story came from Mario Rodríguez: One evening a few days after his release, Rodríguez missed a call from a fellow detainee who was still inside and needed a favor. To help the young man, Rodríguez had to get his alien number, or a-number — a tracking code D.H.S. assigns to noncitizens. Knowing that the young man’s girlfriend, who was named Evelyn, regularly checked his Facebook account for him, Rodríguez sent a message to the account: “necesito el número de A.”<br><br>The message was time-stamped 7:10 p.m. At 7:11 p.m., Rodríguez’s iPhone buzzed not with a Facebook message but a text:<br><br>“Who is this,” the person wrote in English. “This is Mario,” Rodríguez answered, explaining that he was the detainee’s friend from Tacoma. “This is Justin,” the stranger replied. “I’m from Longview” — a town just outside Pacific County. The stranger’s number indeed had a local area code and Longview prefix. “I apologize,” Rodríguez wrote. “I thought this was a response from a text message I sent from Facebook.”<br><br>“And I thought this was a chick named Evelyn who might be able to help me obtain something,” wrote “Justin.”<br><br>Rodríguez wondered how the stranger knew Evelyn’s name and how he had his phone number, and suddenly he was scared again, fearing he would become the collateral in another digitized sting. “I’m sorry,” he wrote. “I don’t know her. Bye.”<br><br>Justin’s number isn’t linked to any person on Spokeo or Nexis, or to anyone on Facebook, or even to any name in the constantly updating files of some of the commercial data brokers ICE itself uses — which is unusual if he truly exists. Later calls and texts to the number would receive no response. There was just a generic recording, in English and Spanish: “The person you’re trying to reach is not accepting calls at this time.” But at least Justin, like many of the strangers lately haunting Pacific County, was polite. “Its all good,” he messaged Rodríguez, “she sold cheap cell phones bye.”<br><br>8. ‘Mission critical’<br><br>Amid the sea of acronyms in Officer Miller and Dietz’s arrest reports from Pacific County — CLAIMS, CIS, IDENT, NCIC, TECS — one database name sticks out: CLEAR, short for Consolidated Lead Evaluation and Reporting. While the other databases the officers list are in some ways unsurprising — they’re mostly federal government systems that run, sometimes ploddingly, on mostly federal government data — CLEAR, a sleek commercial product of Thomson Reuters, is different. CLEAR is powered by personal information: data from credit agencies, cellphone registries, social-media posts, property records, utility accounts, fishing licenses, internet chat rooms and bankruptcy filings, all fused and vetted by algorithm to form an ever-evolving, 360-degree view of U.S. residents’ lives. The Wall Street Journal once memorably dubbed such commercial data brokers “Big Brother-in-Law.” While public attention has lately focused on the Silicon Valley spy contractor Palantir — which in September was in the process of renewing a three-year, almost $50 million contract with H.S.I. — investigative products like CLEAR have received relatively little scrutiny. But E.R.O. has called Thomson Reuters’s services “mission critical.”<br><br>A key benefit of CLEAR, even after Trump’s 2017 executive order exempted most foreign visitors and immigrants from the Privacy Act, is that it isn’t restricted by protections on what data the government can collect or keep — because it isn’t government-owned. It has real-time access to address and name-change data from credit reports and to motor-vehicle registrations in 43 U.S. states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Its utility records, which come from more than 80 electric, gas, water, telephone, cable and satellite television companies nationwide, are updated daily, making it hard for immigrant families — or anyone else — to move into a new home without detection. Incarceration and arrest records, often paired with booking photos that allow for facial-recognition-powered virtual lineups, arrive almost immediately from 2,100 state and local agencies. Some of the jail and arrest data comes from Thomson Reuters’s agreement with a company called Appriss Safety, which runs the database JusticeXchange (now known as Justice Intelligence); the database includes, in spite of Inslee’s sanctuary order, bookings from all over Washington State. A second CLEAR agreement is with Vigilant Solutions, which, according to a 2017 news release, allows Thomson Reuters to integrate its license-plate data into CLEAR. In fact, ICE’s contract isn’t directly with Vigilant. The agency’s subscription fees — averaging more than $2 million a year — go to the Thomson Reuters subsidiary West Publishing. Some data from CLEAR can also be found in another system ICE has used, the privately run law-enforcement network CopLink, which connects the I.T. systems of more than 700 public-safety agencies on a single platform. (Many of these companies have declined to confirm the details of their operations.) As described by Reveal, a publication put out by the Center for Investigative Reporting, Thomson Reuters’s services for ICE also include a custom job the agency has described as “a continuous monitoring and alert system to track 500,000 identities per month.” It notifies E.R.O.’s Targeting Operation Division with every change “in the target’s identifiers.” Thomson Reuters’s government work — which its chief financial officer highlighted in an August 2018 earnings call — has been a strong driver of growth. Including options, its standing contracts with ICE are now worth at least $30 million. At the other end of the data chain, at Washington’s D.O.L., officials who curtailed ICE’s access to DAPS soon had to grapple with how much information might still be leaking to the agency via commercial brokers. First reported here is that in 2017, D.O.L. earned $26,371,232 selling driver and vehicle records to 19 principal data brokers, including Experian, LexisNexis and R.L. Polk — a group of companies that had its own relationships with some 34,500 “subrecipient” brokers, including TransUnion, Acxiom and Thomson Reuters. “One of the things that we realized is that we’re not just a public-safety agency,” D.O.L.’s Brad Benfield told a State Legislature committee in May 2018. “We’re very much a data-sharing agency.”<br><br>In March 2018, D.O.L. sent a team including two auditors to the Detroit offices of R.L. Polk, which it had identified as a data supplier to Thomson Reuters. The auditors determined that no Washington driver or vehicle records had ended up with CLEAR or ICE via this route, Benfield told me — but they found evidence that there was indeed a potential route. “We are working with Polk on what we call a corrective action plan,” he said. 9. ‘Continuous monitoring’<br><br>Look up a Pacific County resident in the files of a data broker, and you’ll find that the more stable the life, the more the person tries to play by the rules, the easier he or she is to find. Even the arrest of a grandfather and 19-year U.S. resident named José Avila, whose disappearance was the next to shock the region after Díaz’s and Rodríguez’s, takes on a kind of machine logic if you see the available data. When I ran Avila’s name through a LexisNexis public-records product, I easily found up-to-date targeting information like the name of his mobile-home park. There were also email addresses: one from an account at EverydayFamily.com — you give the website your data in exchange for free samples of baby products — and one from when he or one of his sons hunted for budget medical schools at ValueMD.com. For almost two decades, Avila’s wife told me, she and her husband made a show of good faith by filing federal taxes. They used an ITIN, or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, in lieu of a Social Security number. This, too, made them trackable: One of ICE’s requirements for Thomson in its “continuous monitoring” system for the agency was that it “return information and addresses” from ITIN data. Miller and Dietz got Avila early one Wednesday in August. “We’re probably going to be doing a vehicle stop,” Miller told the sheriff’s dispatcher, “but the individual doesn’t leave until a little closer to 6:00.” Avila swung out of the driveway in his pickup right on time, and they stopped him. As Sydney Stevens wrote in The Chinook Observer, they let him call one of his sons before confiscating his phone, and when the young man arrived, Avila was gone. His coffee was still warm, and his breakfast, wrapped in a paper towel upon which his youngest son had scrawled “DAD,” was uneaten. I looked up Rosas in the same LexisNexis database. He has a thinner file. Though Officer Miller would later claim to have received a “public tip” calling Rosas a regular drug user — a charge that Rosas and people who know him strongly deny — he has no criminal record of any kind. His address on Bay Avenue is in the file because of a 2014 small-claims case against him for $1,823 in unpaid medical expenses. He had cut his hand on a bucket at work, he told me, and assumed that the emergency room bill had been paid through his employer’s workers’ compensation plan. Eventually, Rosas himself had to pay, and he also paid with his data when his address, taken from court records, made it into the machine. That fall, the Seattle Times reporter Nina Shapiro, the same one to later reveal D.O.L.’s emails with ICE, came to Pacific County to write about the crackdown. For the agency, her article would be an unwelcome spotlight on its practices here — but also a new data point as it monitored a new target: Rosas. Unnamed in the article but quoted extensively and identified as Díaz’s boyfriend, he told Shapiro his family’s separation story, mentioning that his daughters were then in Mexico visiting their mother. To the deportation officers, this seems to have become a “tip indicating that the subject’s children had departed the United States,” as Dietz later wrote. And if Rosas was no longer caring for dependents, he was no longer protected from deportation. ICE, later sued by activist groups in federal court for violating vocal immigrants’ First Amendment rights, including Rosas’, would deny wanting to punish him for talking to the press. “But, I mean, we do read the papers,” Elizabeth Godfrey told me, “so we knew his family situation had changed.”<br><br>At 12:31 p.m. on Oct. 2, 2017, high tide in Willapa Bay, just as the skies above the Long Beach Peninsula dried out and the wind began to blow, Officer Miller entered Rosas’ license plate into DAPS. Perhaps they had passed each other on the highway again. Perhaps they had just met again at Okie’s. Perhaps it was just Rosas’ time. The next day, at 11:52 a.m., Miller emailed the D.O.L. fraud office to request details about a person of interest. The man’s name is redacted in the documents I obtained, but he was born in Guerrero, Mexico, as Rosas was, and he first received a Washington driver’s license in the town of Union Gap, as Rosas did. He originally used a Mexican birth certificate and voter registration to prove his identity — as Miller and Dietz would later determine Rosas had done. “Please send me a copy of his first known application,” Miller wrote. “This subject is under federal investigation.” D.O.L. sent him the documents 12 minutes later. A month passed, and Shapiro’s article about Pacific County appeared in The Seattle Times. Seven days later, on Nov. 16, the deportation officers filled out a Field Operations Worksheet — and Rosas went from person of interest to approved target. After Thanksgiving, on the morning of Nov. 27, the deportation officers woke up early and climbed into their blue Hyundai S.U.V. At 4:58 a.m., Miller called the Pacific County dispatcher: “Ah, yes, ma’am,” he said, “I’m just calling to let you guys know that we’re going to be conducting surveillance and attempting to make an arrest in your area.” At first they sat at the side of Highway 101 near Chinook with their headlights on, lying in wait for a different target. Then they moved 20 miles north to Okie’s, parking in the same lot with Bank of the Pacific where they grabbed Díaz five months before. It was known “that the subject would generally come to the store between 0730 and 0800 each morning,” Dietz explained in his report. At 7:50, Rosas turned into the parking lot, and the deportation officers saw him, and he saw them. They sped toward him in the Hyundai. “Emergency lights were activated in the government vehicle, and the subject was directed to park his vehicle,” Dietz wrote. He didn’t resist. They double-checked Rosas’ driver’s license, which he says that they confiscated and later destroyed, and cuffed him and sat him in the back seat. Miller called the dispatcher again. “I’m just calling to let you guys know that we have one male in custody,” he said. 10. ‘I’m on the boat, and I’ve got to keep going.’<br><br>The story would seem to end there, but it didn’t. It still hasn’t. Rosas would bond out of detention after six weeks, would welcome his daughters home to Ocean Park from Mexico in the spring of 2018 — the youngest was still shuddering whenever she saw a person in a uniform — and would attend a preliminary immigration hearing in Seattle that August. And then he would wait. Like other peninsula residents out on bond, like Mario Rodríguez — who is still on the peninsula and still fighting for asylum based on his sexual orientation and H.I.V. status — Rosas would be caught in the growing case backlog under Trump. His next hearing is in May 2021. The elementary schools are different now on the peninsula, the classrooms whiter, some of the students and staff gone. The oyster farms need workers. The hotels are hiring. ICE officers still periodically appear. Residents still disappear. The activists’ list of the detained or deported now has more than a hundred names, and when Pacific County Immigrant Support held a fund-raiser this summer, 130 people packed the room, together contributing $14,500 to what has become an entrenched fight. The event featured a taco bar, a local band called the Oyster Crackers and a video call-in from a local resident who was being held inside the former Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma, which was recently renamed the Northwest ICE Processing Center. The man made the call using Telmate. The activists gave him a standing ovation. It’s possible that as they stood there, a machine recorded and archived the sounds of their clapping hands. While ICE’s data operations move forward, Washington’s D.O.L. has now spent two years trying to go in reverse. Deportation officers can’t access its databases anymore, not without a court order, and their daily email correspondence with the fraud office is over. “We’ve made many changes,” Christine Anthony, a spokeswoman for D.O.L., said. What may be most unusual about Washington State is not what it collects and not what it has shared but the degree to which it has been forced to become transparent about the vast quantity of personal data that courses through its bureaucracy. For decades, the overriding objective of American business and government has been to remove friction from the tracking system, by linking networks, by speeding connections, by eliminating barriers. But friction is the only thing that has ever made privacy, let alone obscurity, possible. If there’s no friction, if we can all be profiled instantly and intimately, then there’s nothing to stop any of our neighbors from being targeted — nothing, that is, except our priorities. Today Rosas lives with his daughters in a trailer in Tijuanita a couple of hundred feet from their old apartment. He sleeps on the sofa so the girls can share the only bed. He drives them to the school-bus stop in the morning in his truck. He works as much as he can — to buy them food, to pay for babysitters, to send money to Díaz, who sits jobless and lonely in a village near Puerto Vallarta. When she’s in phone range, they call each other on Facebook Messenger — despite the social network’s role in her capture — a half-dozen times a day. He tries not to dwell on how to get her back; his lawyer is working on it, he says. He tries not to dwell on it when he sees ICE around. Officer Miller stopped outside his trailer recently, this time in a different unmarked vehicle, American-made and drab-colored, and Rosas nodded at him, and Miller nodded back, and then the two men simply went about their business. Rosas didn’t have time to do otherwise. “Estoy en el barco,” he explained recently. “That’s a saying we have: I’m on the boat. … I’m on the boat, and I’ve got to keep going.”<br><br>Rosas has now spent half his life in the United States, and he still holds an immigrant’s faith in his chosen country. But two years ago, as Miller and Dietz drove him to Portland for processing, he couldn’t find a way to make sense of a system that purposely targeted someone like him or Díaz, purposely ripping families apart. There was something he couldn’t see, and he knew it was more complex than the two men in the front seat. He decided to forgive them for doing their job. Maybe they were just as stuck as he was. “I’m a fisherman,” he told them. “You’re fishermen, too, for people. I understand you.”","Early on Wednesday afternoon, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, had a fire drill, an eleventh-grader named Gabriella Figueroa told MSNBC’s Brian Williams. “Then we heard gunshots,” Figueroa said. “Then it went to code red. And then it was crazy.”<br><br>An individual with deadly intent was in the school building, holding an assault weapon that was designed for fighting wars. As Figueroa’s use of the term “code red” indicated, such an event is no longer considered an aberration. All across the country, school boards drill their teachers and students in how to respond to such an emergency. Code yellow: turn cell phones to silent, return to the classroom, and follow the teacher’s instructions. Code red: find a secure area immediately, lock the door, close the blinds, turn off the lights, do not move. This lockdown wasn’t a drill, of course. By the time it was over, seventeen people had been shot dead, and more than a dozen had been wounded. “Bodies were lying in the hallway,” another eyewitness told Fox News. “People were killed in the hallway.” Police later identified the suspected killer as Nikolas Cruz, a nineteen-year-old former student who had been expelled for discipline problems. After Cruz fled the scene—he was arrested shortly after the shooting, in neighboring Coral Springs—news helicopters captured footage of students walking and running from the school, some of them carrying flowers and cards. It was Valentine’s Day, after all. By that point, the authorities had secured the area around the school. There were heavily armed cops, police cars, bomb-squad trucks, and F.B.I. vehicles. The mayor of Parkland, a former teacher named Beam Furr, told CNN, “It’s all being fairly well coördinated, and everyone is doing everything they can.”<br><br>But were they? On Twitter, President Donald Trump offered his “prayers and condolences to the families of the victims,” adding that “no child, teacher, or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.” Fox News interviewed Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, who has an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. “I hope people reserve judgment.... The facts of this are important,” Rubio said. As soon as the facts are clear, Rubio went on, “we can have a deeper conversation about why these things happen.” The forty-six-year-old Republican added, “It’s a terrible situation. It’s amazing the amount of carnage that one individual can carry out in such a short period of time.”<br><br>Yet some pertinent facts are already known. According to local police, Cruz was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle—the same type of gun that Adam Lanza used to kill twenty-six pupils and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in December, 2012. Evidently, Rubio still isn’t aware of the power of such weapons, which fire bullets that can penetrate a steel helmet from a distance of five hundred yards. When fired from close range at civilians who aren’t wearing body armor, the bullets from an AR-15 don’t merely penetrate the human body—they tear it apart. It “looks like a grenade went off in there,” Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at the University of Arizona, told Wired. To spare the families of the victims—and the public at large—additional anguish, these sorts of details are often glossed over in the aftermath of mass shootings. But it’s surely long past time that we acknowledged these facts, and that we begin to more fully discuss the complicity of N.R.A.-backed politicians like Rubio, and Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, in maintaining the environment that allows these tragedies to happen again and again and again. One of the first duties of any government is to protect its citizens, through collective action, from violent threats they’d otherwise have to fend off themselves. Even most libertarians accept this principle. But when it comes to mass shootings, the Republican Party falls back on constitutional arguments that have no proper basis in history, and it refuses to budge from this stance. Nothing can shift it—not Sandy Hook, not the Orlando night-club shooting, not the Las Vegas massacre, not weekly shootings in schools. (According to the Guardian, Wednesday’s attack in Parkland was the eighth school shooting this year that has resulted in death or injury.) Nothing. The Democrats aren’t entirely blameless, either. In 2009 and 2010, when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, they failed to take some steps that were obviously necessary, such as closing the gun-show loophole for background checks and reinstating the Clinton Administration’s ban on assault weapons, which the Bush Administration allowed to expire. The Republicans bear the primary responsibility, though. Ever since Sandy Hook, it is their craven subservience to the gun lobby that has prevented meaningful action, even as the carnage that Rubio referred to has continued. “Turn on your televisions right now and you are going to see scenes of children running for their lives,” Chris Murphy, the junior Democratic senator for Connecticut, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon. “Let me just note once again for my colleagues: this happens nowhere else other than the United States of America. This epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting, it only happens here. Not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction. We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.”<br><br>The key concept in that excellent peroration was responsibility. Even with the blood of defenseless children flowing along the corridors of schoolhouses, the U.S. government has abdicated its duty to protect. And that, it bears repeating ad nauseum, is a national disgrace.",2.02,1.8199999999999998,2.4699999999999998,3.98,1.1800000000000002,1.53,0.255,0.8199999999999998,0.7349999999999999,0.03190317460317461,0.05965555555555556,0.047238749999999996

The House Intelligence Committee’s ranking Democrat begins his long-awaited memo — the minority response to the Nunes memo that was penned by staffers of the committee’s Republican majority — by slamming Chairman Devin Nunes’s unconscionable “risk of public exposure of sensitive sources and methods for no legitimate purpose.” The Schiff memo, which has been delayed for weeks because the FBI objected to its gratuitous effort to publicize highly classified intelligence, including methods and sources, then proceeds to tell its tale through what appear to be scores of blacked-out redactions of information Schiff pushed to expose. Heavy Reliance on Steele Dossier Confirmed<br><br>The FBI and the Justice Department heavily relied on the Steele dossier’s uncorroborated allegations. You know this is true because, notwithstanding the claim that “only narrow use” was made “of information from Steele’s sources,” the Democrats end up acknowledging that “only narrow use” actually means significant use — as in, the dossier was the sine qua non of the warrant application. The memo concedes that the FISA-warrant application relied on allegations by Steele’s anonymous Russian hearsay sources that:<br><br>Page met separately while in Russia with Igor Sechin, a close associate of Vladimir Putin and executive chairman of Roseneft, Russia’s state-owned oil company, and Igor Divyekin, a senior Kremlin official. Sechin allegedly discussed the prospect of future U.S.-Russia energy cooperation and “an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western sanctions against Russia.” Divyekin allegedly disclosed to Page that the Kremlin possessed compromising information on Clinton (“kompromat”) and noted the possibility of its being released to Candidate #1’s [i.e., Donald Trump’s] campaign. . . . This closely tracks what other Russian contacts were informing another Trump foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos. This passage puts the lie to two of the main Democratic talking points:<br><br>1) This was obviously the most critical allegation against Page. The Democrats attempt to make much of Page’s trip to Moscow in July 2016, but the uncorroborated Sechin and Divyekin meetings, which Page credibly denies, are the aspect of the Moscow trip that suggested a nefarious Trump–Russia conspiracy. That’s what the investigation was about. Far from clandestine, the rest of Page’s trip was well publicized and apparently anodyne. And saliently — for reasons we’ll get to in due course — Page was clearly prepared to talk to the FBI about the trip if the Bureau wanted to know what he was up to. It is the Steele dossier that alleges Page was engaged in arguably criminal activity. The Democrats point to nothing else that does. Moreover, because Page was an American citizen, FISA law required that the FBI and the DOJ show not only that he was acting as an agent of a foreign power (Russia), but also that his “clandestine” activities on behalf of Russia were a likely violation of federal criminal law. (See FISA, Section 1801(b)(2)(A) through (E), Title 50, U.S. Code.) It is the Steele dossier that alleges Page was engaged in arguably criminal activity. The Democrats point to nothing else that does. 2) Democrats implausibly insist that what “launched” the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation was not Steele’s allegations but intelligence from Australia about George Papadopoulos’s contact with what Democrats elusively describe as “individuals linked to Russia.” As we learned when Papadopoulos pled guilty, though, it is anything but clear that these “individuals linked to Russia” had much in the way of links to Putin’s regime: London-based academic Joseph Mifsud, who is from Malta and apparently does not speak Russian; an unidentified woman who falsely pretended to be Putin’s niece; and Ivan Timofeev, a program director at a Russian-government-funded think tank. Even if we assume for argument’s sake that these characters had solid regime connections — rather than that they were boasting to impress the credulous young Papadopoulos — they were patently not in the same league as Sechin, a Putin crony, and Divyekin, a highly placed regime official. And that, manifestly, is how the FBI and the DOJ saw the matter: They sought a FISA warrant on Page, not Papadopoulos. And, as the above-excerpted passage shows, they highlighted the Steele dossier’s sensational allegations about Page and then feebly tried to corroborate those allegations with some Papadopoulos information, not the other way around. (More on that when we get to Schiff’s notion of “corroboration.”)<br><br>Concealing the Dossier’s Clinton-Campaign Origins<br><br>Another major takeaway from the Schiff memo is that the FBI and the DOJ withheld from the FISA court the fact that Steele’s work was a project of the Clinton campaign. Naturally, the reader must ferret this admission out of a couple of dense paragraphs, in which Democrats risibly claim that the “DOJ was transparent with the Court about Steele’s sourcing.”<br><br>How’s this for transparency? The FISA warrant application says that Steele, referred to as “Source #1,” was “approached by” Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, referred to as “an identified U.S. person,” who<br><br>indicated to Source #1 that a U.S.-based law firm had hired the identified U.S. Person to conduct research regarding Candidate #1’s [i.e., Trump’s] ties to Russia. (The identified U.S. Person and Source #1 have a longstanding business relationship.) The identified U.S. Person hired Source #1 to conduct this research. The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1’s ties to Russia. The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s campaign. [Emphasis in Schiff memo, p. 5]<br><br>The first thing to notice here is the epistemological contortions by which the DOJ rationalized concealing that the Clinton campaign and the DNC paid for Steele’s reporting. They ooze consciousness of guilt. If you have to go through these kinds of mental gymnastics to avoid disclosing something, it’s because you know that being “transparent” demands disclosing it. Next, Schiff — again, hilariously enough to make you wonder if it’s done tongue-in-cheek — accuses Nunes of hypocrisy for condemning the omission of Mrs. Clinton’s name after having rebuked the Obama administration’s “unmasking” of American names. Of course, the two things have nothing to do with each other. “Unmasking” refers to the revelation of American identities in intelligence reports. These are Americans who, though not targeted as foreign agents, are incidentally intercepted in surveillance. In marked contrast, we are talking here about a FISA warrant application, not an intelligence report. In a warrant application, it is the DOJ’s honorable practice, and the judiciary’s expectation, that the court must be informed about the material biases of the sources of the factual allegations that the DOJ claims amount to probable cause. As the Democrats’ own excerpt from the FISA application illustrates, unmasking has nothing to do with it, because there is no need to use names at all: Note that Simpson is referred to as “an identified U.S. person”; Perkins-Coie is referred to as “a U.S.-based law firm.” The dispute here is not about the failure to use the words “Hillary Clinton.” They could have referred to “Candidate #2.” To state that “Candidate #2” had commissioned Steele’s research would have been just as easy and every bit as appropriate as the DOJ’s reference to a “Candidate #1,” who might have “ties to Russia.” Had DOJ done the former, it would not have “unmasked” Hillary Clinton any more than Donald Trump was unmasked by DOJ’s description of him as “Candidate #1”; but it would have been being “transparent” with the FISA court. By omitting any reference to Clinton, the DOJ was being the opposite of transparent. Two other things to notice here. 1) The DOJ’s application asserted: “The identified U.S. Person never advised Source #1 as to the motivation behind the research into Candidate #1’s ties to Russia.” There is only one reason to include such a statement: The DOJ well understood that the implied biases in the process of compiling the dossier’s allegations, including Steele’s implied biases, were material to the FISA court’s evaluation. A prosecutor does not get to tell a judge reasons that a source’s reports should be thought free of bias while leaving out why they should not be thought free of bias. If you know it’s necessary to disclose that “identified U.S. person” Simpson was being paid by “a U.S.-based law firm” (Perkins-Coie), then it is at least equally necessary to disclose that, in turn, the law firm was being paid by its clients: the Clinton campaign and the DNC. To tell half the story is patently misleading. 2) Schiff comically highlights this DOJ assertion as if it were his home run, when it is in fact damning: “The FBI speculates that the identified U.S. Person was likely looking for information that could be used to discredit Candidate #1’s campaign.” This is the vague reference that Democrats and Trump critics laughably say was adequate disclosure of the dossier’s political motivation. But why would the FBI “speculate” that a political motive was “likely” involved when, in reality, the FBI well knew that a very specific political motive was precisely involved? There was no reason for supposition here. If the FBI had transparently disclosed that the dossier was a product of the Clinton campaign — oh, sorry, didn’t mean to unmask; if the FBI had transparently disclosed that the dossier was a product of “Candidate #2’s” campaign — then the court would have been informed about the apodictic certainty that the people behind the dossier were trying to discredit the campaign of Candidate #2’s opponent. It is disingenuous to tell a judge that something is “likely” when, in fact, it is beyond any doubt. The Issue Is the Credibility of Steele’s Informants, Not of Steele Himself<br><br>When the Justice Department seeks a warrant from a court, the credibility that matters is not that of the agent who has assembled the information from the informants; it is that of the informants who observe the fact matters that are claimed to be a basis for finding probable cause. That is, what mattered was the credibility of Steele’s anonymous Russian sources, not the credibility of Steele himself. By dwelling on the countless reasons why Schiff is wrong about the adequacy of the disclosure of Steele’s biases, I am falling into the trap I have warned against (here, and in section C here). The FBI and the DOJ relied vicariously on Steele’s credibility, as a substitute for their failure to corroborate his informants’ information. It was improper to do this. To be clear, the only reason Steele’s own biases have any pertinence is that the FBI and the DOJ relied vicariously on Steele’s credibility, as a substitute for their failure to corroborate his informants’ information. It was improper to do this. Yet even if a prosecutor goes down a certain road wrongly, the duty to be candid with the tribunal still applies. The prosecutor is obliged to tell the whole story about potential bias, not a skewed version. Schiff’s memo struggles mightily, and futilely, to demonstrate that Steele’s credibility issues were sufficiently disclosed. But that is a side issue. The question is whether Steele’s informants were credible. To the limited extent that committee Democrats grapple with this problem, they tell us that, after the first FISA application, the FBI and the DOJ provided additional information that corroborated Steele’s informants. There are four problems with this:<br><br>1) It would not justify using uncorroborated allegations in the first warrant. 2) The supposedly corroborative information is blacked out; while that may be an appropriate protection of sensitive intelligence, we are still left having to take Schiff’s word for it. 3) Taking Schiff’s word for it would be unwise given his memo’s warped conception of “corroboration.” Recall the Schiff memo passage excerpted in the first section above. In the last part, the Democrats argue that the dossier claim that Page met with Kremlin official Divyekin was somehow corroborated because it “closely tracked” what Papadopoulos was hearing from his dubious “Russian contacts.” But the supposed “Russian contacts” were telling Papadopoulos that the Kremlin had thousands of Clinton-related emails. That did nothing to confirm Steele’s claim that Page had met with Divyekin, a top regime official; nor did it corroborate that the “kompromat” Divyekin referred to was the same thing as the emails that Papadopoulos’s “Russian contacts” were talking about. (Of course, it may well be that Page never actually met with Divyekin and that Papadopoulos’s sources were wrong about emails; if so, committee Democrats are in the strange position of contending that the non-existent can corroborate the non-existent.) 4) Most significantly, Democrats seem not to grasp that the flaw here lies not merely in the failure to corroborate the information from Steele’s sources. There appears not even to be corroboration that these sources existed — i.e., that they are real people whose claims are accurately reported. Indeed, it is worse than that. Even if we stipulate for argument’s sake that Steele’s anonymous Russian informants are authentic, they are generally hearsay witnesses, one or more steps removed from the events they relate. The real question, then, is whether the informants’ sources are real, identifiable, reliable informants. Based on what has been disclosed, we must assume that the FBI did not know. That is why the DOJ inappropriately tried to rely on Steele’s credibility. The FBI Interviews of Carter Page<br><br>In the course of providing a skewed portrait of Carter Page’s background, the Schiff memo unintentionally highlights another deep flaw in the warrant application. The memo limns Page as a master spy with disturbing “connections to Russian Government and Intelligence Officials” — which will be amusing to anyone who has seen an interview of Page, now a ubiquitous oddball media presence. What Democrats conveniently omit is that (a) Page cooperated with the FBI and Justice Department in a prior investigation in which his information was used to prosecute Russian spies; (b) the Russian spies explicitly regarded him as an “idiot” (and they had not even seen him on cable TV); and (c) since Russian operatives can be as diabolical and sophisticated as the Democrats suggest, they would have known that Page did not have the kind of relationship with Trump that would have made Page a suitable conduit for proposing traitorous deals — and as we’ve seen, the Russians had far better ways to approach Trump (e.g., the Kremlin-connected oligarch Aras Agalarov, who had a personal relationship with Trump and orchestrated the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting). The memo does note that “the FBI also interviewed Page multiple times about his Russian intelligence contacts.” Apparently, these interviews stretch back to 2013. The memo also lets slip that there was at least one more interview with Page in March 2016, before the counterintelligence investigation began. We must assume that Page was a truthful informant since his information was used in a prosecution against Russian spies and Page himself has never been accused of lying to the FBI. Why didn’t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance? It is a requirement of FISA law. So . . . here’s the question: When Steele brought the FBI his unverified allegations that Page had met with Sechin and Divyekin, why didn’t the FBI call Page in for an interview rather than subject him to FISA surveillance? Lest you wonder, this is not an instance of me second-guessing the Bureau with an investigative plan I think would have been better. It is a requirement of FISA law. When the FBI and DOJ apply for a FISA warrant, they must convince the court that surveillance — a highly intrusive tactic by which the government monitors all of an American citizen’s electronic communications — is necessary because the foreign-intelligence information the government seeks “cannot reasonably be obtained by normal investigative techniques.” (See FISA, Section 1804(a)(6)(C) of Title 50, U.S. Code.) Normal investigative techniques include interviewing the subject. There are, of course, situations in which such alternative investigative techniques would inevitably fail — a mafia don or a jihadist is not likely to sit down with FBI agents and tell them everything he knows. But Carter Page was not only likely to do so, he had a documented history of providing information to the FBI. It would be very interesting to see what the DOJ told the FISA court about why normal investigative techniques would not suffice to pry information from Page. They certainly seem to work fine for Fox News. The Page Surveillance Enabled Interception of Past Communications<br><br>The Schiff memo repeats the canard that the Obama administration was not really spying on the Trump campaign because the DOJ waited until the Trump campaign cut ties with Page before seeking a surveillance warrant. What Democrats fail to mention is that the surveillance enabled the FBI to intercept not only his forward-going communications but also any stored emails and texts he might have had. Clearly, they were hoping to find a motherlode of campaign communications. Remember, Page was merely the vehicle for surveillance; the objective was to probe Trump ties to Russia. The “Closely Held Investigative Team”<br><br>Schiff is determined to run with the implausible story that George Papadopoulos is the face that launched a thousand ships — that Papadopoulos’s boozy conversation with an Australian diplomat, not the Steele dossier’s allegations of a traitorous Trump–Russia conspiracy, was the true impetus for the counterintelligence investigation. Schiff maintains that the FBI was therefore not even paying attention to Steele until long after the Papadopoulos information came in. That is, even though the Bureau started receiving Steele’s reports in July 2016, they did not make their way to the FBI’s “closely held investigative team” for some seven weeks — i.e., until mid September. This team is described elsewhere (p. 3) in the Schiff memo as “the counterintelligence team investigating Russia at FBI headquarters.” Of course, by mid September, Steele and Fusion GPS were leaking Steele’s allegations to many favored reporters, so perhaps Schiff is saying that the “closely held investigative team” read about them in the news. It is, in any event, a frivolous point. The fact that the Bureau administratively opened a case on Papadopoulos does not mean that much of anything was done on it. As we know, investigators did not even interview Papadopoulos until late January 2017, after Trump had already taken office and about six months after they received the info about Papadopoulos. By contrast, once the “closely held investigative team” got the Steele dossier, the FBI and the DOJ were at the FISA court’s doorstep tout de suite. And to repeat, they got a surveillance warrant for Page, not Papadopoulos. Meantime, Schiff needs to make up his mind about the significance of the “closely held investigative team.” Near the end of the memo, he raps Nunes for pointing to the anti-Trump animus evident in the texts of FBI agent Peter Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page. These Bureau officials are not important, Schiff says, because neither of them was the “affiant” on any of the FISA warrant applications. But wait: Strzok and Page were part of the “closely held investigative team,” which Schiff has only just told us are the only FBI personnel who matter. Anyway, though he is wont to remind us every few minutes that he is a former prosecutor, Schiff seems unfamiliar with how investigations work. The affiant on a warrant application aggregates the information of many agents and informants. A warrant is a team effort, which I had thought was why Schiff stressed the “closely held investigative team.” And Page was a lawyer, not an agent, so though she would presumably not be the affiant on a warrant application, she may well have participated in the FBI’s legal review of the applications, which occurs both in-house and in consultation with Justice Department lawyers. Four Different FISA-Court Judges<br><br>Schiff makes much of the fact that the four FISA warrants (the original authorization and three renewals, at 90-day intervals) were signed by four different FISA-court judges — all apparently appointed to the federal district courts by Republican presidents. This hardly commends the validity of the warrants. In criminal surveillance orders, for example, it is common for prosecutors to bring renewal applications back to the same judge who authorized the original surveillance. That judge presumably knows the case better and is thus in a superior position to detect any irregularities. If FISA surveillance works differently, that would be another reason for critics to fear that the court is merely a rubber stamp. (For what it’s worth, I don’t share the view that the FISA court merely rubber-stamps applications. The process is a give-and-take one, and though the FISA court rarely rejects warrants, the DOJ does modify many warrants in response to the court’s concerns. Moreover, since surveillance of foreign threats to the U.S. is an executive responsibility, the court should approve them unless it appears that the FBI and the DOJ are abusing the process.) In any event, the issue here is failure to disclose information to the court. If a judge was not made aware of material facts, the judge’s authorization of a warrant does not validate the derelict application. (That said, it is difficult to understand why judges would not be troubled by the lack of corroboration of Steele’s unidentified Russian hearsay informants.) The Basis for Steele’s Termination as an FBI Informant<br><br>The FISA judges were not told that Steele had lied to the FBI about contacts with the press. The Schiff memo is disingenuous in claiming that the warrant applications were forthright with the FISA court about the reasons for Steele’s termination as an FBI source. The Grassley-Graham memo explains (as I’ve previously detailed) that the court was apparently told that Steele was dismissed over contacts with the press. The FISA judges were not told that Steele had lied to the FBI about contacts with the press. Papadopoulos and the Clinton Emails<br><br>Committee Democrats misrepresent a significant fact derived from Special Counsel Mueller’s statement of Papadopoulos’s offense (filed when the latter pled guilty). The Schiff memo states<br><br>We would later learn in Papadopoulos’s plea that the information the Russians could assist by anonymously releasing were thousands of Hillary Clinton’s emails. What we actually learned in Papadopoulos’s plea was that his dubious Russian sources had heard that the Kremlin had the emails. There is no indication that the Kremlin in fact had the emails; the Kremlin apparently provided no emails to Papadopoulos (or anyone else in Trump’s orbit); and there is no evidence that the “Russia-linked” people to whom Papadopoulos spoke knew what they were talking about — it is at least as plausible that they were playing Papadopoulos. The Use of a Media Report to ‘Corroborate’ Steele<br><br>Committee Democrats make a highly unlikely claim about the DOJ’s controversial use in the FISA warrant applications of a Yahoo News report by journalist Michael Isikoff. The claim appears to be contradicted by both the aforementioned Grassley-Graham memo and by the Isikoff article itself. Specifically, the Schiff memo denies the Republican claim that the DOJ tried to corroborate Steele’s allegations by relying on Isikoff’s media story, dated September 23, 2016. Rather, Schiff says the Isikoff report was mentioned for a righteous purpose: “to inform the Court of Page’s public denial of his suspected meetings in Russia” (with Sechin and Divyekin). The memo further claims that the FISA application cited another news story along these lines, but that the Nunes memo withheld this detail. Schiff’s version has two problems. 1) While it is true (as noted above) that Page denies meeting Sechin and Divyekin, it is not true that this denial is reported in Isikoff’s article. Instead, Isikoff reported that Page “declined repeated requests to comment for this story.” He added that, while in Moscow in July 2016, “Page declined to say whether he was meeting with Russian officials during his trip” — not that he denied doing so. Isikoff, who is a superb reporter, also took pains to explain that it was merely “alleged” that Page had met with high-ranking Russians — that is, the meetings had not been confirmed. But there is nothing in Isikoff’s article about Page himself denying that they occurred. It is therefore hard to understand why the DOJ would, as Schiff suggests, include the article as a way of informing the court that Page denied the meetings. 2) Schiff’s version is contradicted by the Grassley-Graham memo, which quotes the FISA warrant application. Senators Charles Grassley and Lindsey Graham recount (memo, p. 3) that “the FISA applications note the existence of” Isikoff’s article, “which in particular contained some of the same dossier information about Mr. Page compiled by Mr. Steele and on which the FBI relied in its application.” The senators then quote from the FISA application, which said:<br><br>Given that the information contained in the September 23rd news article generally matches the information about Page that [Steele] discovered during his/her research, [two lines redacted.] The FBI does not believe that [Steele] directly provided this information to the press. [Brackets in original]<br><br>The senators’ memo strongly suggests that Nunes is right and Schiff is wrong: The Isikoff article was used precisely because, to quote the DOJ again, it “generally matched” Steele’s allegations about Page. In effect, the DOJ was using Steele to corroborate Steele. Schiff’s Defense of Bruce Ohr<br><br>Schiff’s attack on the Nunes memo for referring to top Justice Department official Bruce Ohr’s connections with Steele is utterly unpersuasive — a “How dare you” argument that rests on Schiff’s description of Ohr as “a well-respected career professional.”<br><br>Republicans did not attack Ohr personally or belittle his law-enforcement credentials. To the contrary, the Nunes memo argued that because Ohr was a high-ranking official — the right-hand of Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, who was effectively running DOJ — it should have been disclosed to the court that (a) Ohr was meeting with Steele about the anti-Trump project; (b) Steele had told Ohr in September (i.e., before the first FISA application) that he “was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about him not being president”; and (c) Ohr’s wife, Nellie Ohr, was a Russia expert at Fusion who was collaborating with Steele on the dossier. If Schiff thinks that is unreasonable, I expect most people will disagree. Conclusion<br><br>In sum, the Schiff memo does more to harm than to advance the Democrats’ defense of the Obama administration and the use of the FISA process by the FBI and the DOJ.","On February 12th, President Trump had his 189th, 190th, 191st, and 192nd judicial nominees confirmed by the senate. 51 of his judicial nominations have been for the federal appeals courts, and ten of those have been on the now-formerly heavy leftist 9th Circuit, where Trump has made 10 appointments in three years. He has effectively flipped the 9th circuit from wackjob leftist to sane, and this has wackjob leftists worried. Bigly. Townhall notes that 1/4 of all federal circuit court judges are Trump appointees. Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>When President Trump ticks off his accomplishments since taking office, he frequently mentions his aggressive makeover of a key sector of the federal judiciary — the circuit courts of appeal, where he has appointed 51 judges to lifetime jobs in three years. In few places has the effect been felt more powerfully than in the sprawling 9th Circuit, which covers California and eight other states. Because of Trump’s success in filling vacancies, the San Francisco-based circuit, long dominated by Democratic appointees, has suddenly shifted to the right, with an even more pronounced tilt expected in the years ahead. TRENDING: Things Just Got Weird: MSNBC Dandy and Nutbag Malcolm Nance Dresses in Military Gear and Says He's Fighting in Ukraine in New Video<br><br>Trump has now named 10 judges to the 9th Circuit — more than one-third of its active judges — compared with seven appointed by President Obama over eight years. “Trump has effectively flipped the circuit,” said 9th Circuit Judge Milan D. Smith Jr., an appointee of President George W. Bush. Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>“Ten new people at once sends a shock wave through the system,” a 9th Circuit judge said. Among those who have caused the most consternation is Judge Daniel P. Collins, a former federal prosecutor and partner of a prestigious law firm. Some judges said that in the early months of his tenure, Collins has appeared oblivious to court tradition. He has sent memos at all times of the night in violation of a court rule and objected to other judges’ rulings in language that some colleagues found combative, they said. Collins also moved quickly to challenge rulings by his new colleagues, calling for review of five decisions by three-judge panels, and some of the calls came before Collins even had been assigned to his first panel, judges said. Democratic appointees still make up the majority of active judges — 16 to 13. But the court also has judges on “senior status” who continue to sit on panels that decide cases. Senior status rank gives judges more flexibility but allows them to continue to work, even full time. Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>Of the senior judges who will be deciding cases on “merits” panels — reading briefs and issuing rulings — 10 are Republicans and only three are Democratic appointees, Smith said. “You will see a sea change in the 9th Circuit on day-to-day decisions,” Smith predicted. The biggest change will come in controversial cases that test the constitutionality of laws and the legal ability of presidents to establish contentious new rules. The 9th Circuit is weighing challenges to Trump on a wide array of issues, from immigration to reproductive rights, and the rightward tilt is likely to make it easier for the president to prevail. Though conservative, the Trump appointees to the 9th Circuit are not monolithic. Two Trump appointees — Bade, a former federal court magistrate, and Mark J. Bennett, a former attorney general of Hawaii — are regarded by their colleagues as experienced and collegial. Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>Trump appointee Eric D. Miller also has drawn positive reviews from both Democratic and Republican appointees. Before his appointment, Miller headed up the appellate division of a major law firm. “I think he will be a good judge,” a 9th Circuit veteran said. The 9th Circuit court has been dominated by Democratic appointees for decades. In 1978, a federal law created 10 new judgeships on the court, allowing President Carter to fill them all. The liberal Carter appointees were followed by judges named by three Republican presidents and two Democrats. Clinton’s and Obama’s appointees were not uniformly liberal, however, and the 9th Circuit has been growing more moderate. One study, examining the years 2010 to 2015, found that the 9th Circuit was the third most reversed by the Supreme Court, following the Ohio-based 6th and Georgia-based 11th circuits. Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>Still, with Democratic nominees heavily outnumbering Republicans, there were usually enough votes to overturn conservative decisions by three-judge panels. Smith predicted the full effect of the Trump appointees won’t be seen until 2021, when they will be carrying full caseloads. But even now Democratic appointees are likely to be more reluctant to ask for 11-judge panels to review conservative decisions because the larger en banc panels, chosen randomly, might be dominated by Republicans, judges said. Hold on, sitting judges are speaking to media, gossiping about other judges to the media? Turns out they are violating their own ethical standards by doing that! Last September, “sources familiar with the private Supreme Court deliberations” talked to CNN about the Census Case. It was not clear who spoke to the media. Was it one or more Justices? Law clerks? Court staff? People who were in touch with the Justices or law clerks? These leaks were troubling. Confidential deliberations should remain confidential–especially when press reports paint some members of the Court in an unfavorable light. These disclosures corrode collegiality. Indeed, there have been new rounds of rumors about leaks in the Title VII SOGI cases. This problem, regrettably, is not limited to the Supreme Court. On Saturday, Maura Dolan of the L.A. Times interviewed “several judges on the 9th Circuit” about the impact of President Trump’s new nominees. Dolan noted that “some” of the judges “declined to discuss their colleagues or inner deliberations.” That “some” should have been “all.” Why would any judges discuss their “colleagues” or opine on “internal deliberations”? Alas, some judges “refused to be quoted by name, saying they were not authorized to speak about what goes on behind the scenes.” In other words they spoke on background, not for attribution. Judges cannot speak on background. Ever. Generally, when a source says, “I am not authorized to speak publicly,” that statement suggests that, given the proper authorization, she could speak publicly. But judges can never speak publicly about internal deliberations. No authorization can be given by any superior authority. Shame on those judges who spoke on background to the press. Reason specifically called out Judges Milan D. Smith and Kim McLane Wardlaw, who went on record with the media to complain about Trump’s appointees. Meanwhile, the crazed leftists at Vox fan the flames of fear over these judicial appointments:<br><br>In less than three years as president, President Trump has done nearly as much to shape the courts as President Obama did in eight years. Trump hasn’t simply given lots of lifetime appointments to lots of lawyers. He’s filled the bench with some of the smartest, and some of the most ideologically reliable, men and women to be found in the conservative movement. Long after Trump leaves office, these judges will shape American law — pushing it further and further to the right even if the voters soundly reject Trumpism in 2020. It’s tempting to assume that Trump’s judicial appointees share the goonish incompetence of the man who placed them on the bench, but this assumption could not be more wrong. His picks include leading academics, Supreme Court litigators, and already prominent judges who now enjoy even more power within the judiciary. There’s no completely objective way to measure legal ability, but a common metric used by legal employers to identify the most gifted lawyers is whether those lawyers secured a federal clerkship, including the most prestigious clerkships at the Supreme Court. Approximately 40 percent of Trump’s appellate nominees clerked for a Supreme Court justice, and about 80 percent clerked on a federal court of appeals. That compares to less than a quarter of Obama’s nominees who clerked on the Supreme Court, and less than half with a federal appellate clerkship. In other words, based solely on objective legal credentials, the average Trump appointee has a far more impressive résumé than any past president’s nominees. And they’re young, too. “The average age of circuit judges appointed by President Trump is less than 50 years old,” the Trump White House bragged in early November, “a full 10 years younger than the average age of President Obama’s circuit nominees.”<br><br>Trump’s nominees will serve for years or even decades after being appointed. Even if Democrats crush the 2020 elections and win majorities in both houses of Congress, these judges will have broad authority to sabotage the new president’s agenda. In an age of legislative dysfunction, whoever controls the courts controls the country. In the past decade or so — or more precisely, since Republicans took over the House in 2011 — Congress has been barely functional. You can count on one hand — and possibly on just a few fingers — the major legislation it has enacted. Judges, by contrast, have become the most consequential policymakers in the nation. They have gutted America’s campaign finance law and dismantled much of the Voting Rights Act. They have allowed states to deny health coverage to millions of Americans. They’ve held that religion can be wielded as a sword to cut away the rights of others. They’ve drastically watered down the federal ban on sexual harassment. And that barely scratches the surface. The judiciary is where policy is made in the United States. And that policy is likely to be made by Republican judges for the foreseeable future. And that’s not all. In the coming months, the courts are poised to gut abortion rights, eviscerate gun control, and neuter landmark environmental laws. Federal judges have already stripped workers of their ability to assert many of their rights against their employers, and this process is likely to accelerate in the near future. Many of our voting rights lay in tatters, thanks to conservative judicial appointments, and this process is likely to accelerate as well. When Congress has been unable to function, the executive branch has relied on existing federal laws that delegate some policymaking authority to federal agencies, in order to deal with many of the nation’s pressing needs. But with the Supreme Court poised to give judges a veto power over these agencies’ actions, the courts could in effect strike down any regulation they dislike. In a Republican-controlled judiciary, this likely means that Republican administrations will retain broad discretionary authority, but Democratic administrations will be hobbled. And here’s the thing: We probably will not fully understand just how much power Trump’s judges will wield until after Trump leaves office. Right now, the executive branch is ideologically aligned with Trump’s judges, so those judges are less likely to object to the Trump administration’s actions than more liberal jurists. But it’s a fairly safe bet that Trump’s judges would spend an Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden administration wreaking havoc on the new president’s agenda — and that any future Democratic president will face similar opposition. And that’s what scares the left the most. Trump’s judges are competent and qualified litigators who will be on benches for years opposing wacked out leftist policies. Since many laws are left vague on purpose by state legislators and US lawmakers, it’s left to the courts to interpret the laws.","Mueller's team of Dem donors under fire from Trump as probe hits one-year mark<br><br>The long and winding special counsel Russia investigation that President Trump has routinely decried as a “witch hunt” hit the one-year mark on Thursday – giving Trump’s legal team an opening to renew criticism of the probe’s focus and its investigators. ""Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction,"" Trump tweeted Thursday. Legal team member Rudy Giuliani told Fox News on Wednesday that Mueller already has assured them the president can't be indicted. And he said earlier this week that the president's lawyers would use the 'anniversary' to double down on calls to wrap up the investigation. Expect more vocal reminders from the president's team Thursday that the past year has yielded no collusion-related charges. “This case is essentially over. They’re just in denial,” Giuliani told Fox News' John Roberts. Trump himself already has started to ramp up accusations of alleged political bias on the Mueller team itself, composed of largely registered Democrats or Democratic donors. This could be a recurring theme if the case continues to drag on. “The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice…and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!” Trump tweeted last week. Mueller’s team is composed of 17 attorneys, 13 of which are Democrats. At least nine have donated to Democratic candidates and causes. Mueller, however, is said to be a life-long Republican and served as FBI director under former Republican President George W. Bush. Among the team members is Jeannie Rhee, a former partner at WilmerHale—the high-profile law firm where Mueller worked prior to taking on the special counsel role—and former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. She is a registered Democrat and donated a total of $5,400 to Hillary Clinton in 2015 and 2016. Rhee also donated a combined $4,800 to former President Barack Obama in 2008, and the same amount again in 2011. Rhee has contributed smaller amounts of money to the Democratic National Committee and multiple Democrats running for Congress. Rhee also represented Obama Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes during the House Select Committee on Benghazi’s investigation of the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attack, as well as the Clinton Foundation in 2015 against a racketeering lawsuit brought by conservative legal activist group Freedom Watch. And Rhee represented Clinton in a lawsuit seeking access to her private emails. Another attorney on Mueller’s team is James Quarles, who served as former assistant special prosecutor for the Watergate Special Prosecution Force and also was a former partner at WilmerHale. He is a registered Democrat and has donated significant sums to Democratic candidates: $2,700 to Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016, and more than $7,000 to Obama over the last decade. Quarles did, however, donate $2,500 to former Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, in 2015. Then there's Andrew Weissmann, former general counsel at the FBI and former assistant U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York. He is a registered Democrat and donated a combined $2,300 to Obama’s campaign in 2008. In 2006, Weissmann contributed at least $2,000 to the DNC. Another attorney, on detail from the Southern District of New York, is Andrew Goldstein, a registered Democrat who donated a combined $3,300 to Obama’s campaigns in 2008 and 2012. The Special Counsel’s Office told Fox News last year that they had no comment on allegations of potential bias on the team. Justice Department policies and federal law prohibit discriminating based on political affiliation when it comes to hiring for nonpolitical positions. In the lead-up to the one-year mark, Trump on Tuesday blasted what he estimated to be a $10 million “Russian Witch Hunt,” boasting that despite the drawn-out investigation, his approval numbers are improving. Giuliani also said in a recent interview with Bloomberg that it's time to end the investigation, and warned they are prepared for battle: “We don’t want to signal our action if this doesn’t work—we are going to hope they listen to us—but obviously we have a Plan B and C.”<br><br>He did not specify what those plans might be. Other attorneys on Mueller’s team -- like Elizabeth Prelogar, Brandon Van Grack, Rush Atkinson, Kyle Freeny, and Greg Andres -- are registered Democrats and have contributed smaller sums of money to Democratic candidates. Whether Mueller is sitting on any damaging information about the president remains to be seen. In claiming there would not be an indictment, Giuliani made clear Mueller is bound by a 1999 Justice Department memo under the Clinton administration. The next big question is whether Trump will agree to an interview with Mueller. Giuliani told Fox News this week that the president's legal team hoped to make a decision about a Mueller-Trump interview by the May 17 anniversary -- but has not received a response from the special counsel on various requests for information. While Trump insists there has been ""no collusion,"" Mueller’s team has secured numerous indictments and received several guilty pleas from people involved in Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign -- though none of those charges dealt with collusion. WHO'S BEEN CHARGED BY MUELLER IN THE RUSSIA PROBE SO FAR? Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn was charged and pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI about his communications with the Russian ambassador; former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort was indicted on 32 counts in February, and also charged in a 12-count indictment in October; and former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI. Mueller’s team has also charged 13 Russian nationals for allegedly interfering in the election.

Revisions and archived links added. Top Five Most Racist Presidents<br><br>The most celebrated Democratic presidents are also – by far – the most race-obsessed. These American presidents care much less about content of character than they do about melanin levels. Whether their obsession is how black Americans can help launch the Democrats into power, such as in the case of Lyndon B. Johnson; or if the disdain for the “other” is really just straight-up racism, such as in the case of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the common thread – of progressivism – remains. 5.) Lyndon B. Johnson<br><br>Several particularly egregious and racist quotes have been attributed to LBJ. As observed on February 3, 1991 at the New York Times, LBJ said in 1948 that President Truman’s civil rights proposal…<br><br>…is a farce and a sham…I have voted against the so-called poll tax repeal bill … I have voted against the so-called anti-lynching bill. So why was LBJ for Republican-passed civil rights legislation in 1964 (a watered-down version of the 1957 civil rights legislation under Eisenhower), but against it in 1948? LBJ was evidently not concerned about the plight of black Americans but rather about the continuation of a progressive agenda. Consider that LBJ’s failed “$20 trillion taxpayer-funded war on poverty” known as the Orwellion-sounding “great society” program has been the single greatest contributor of the breakdown of black families in America. As noted at Business Insider:<br><br>There is more drug addiction and more social and family breakdown among this population than when the Great Society was launched. LBJ pushed ahead with his “great society” program “which gave rise to Medicaid, Head Start and a broad range of other federal anti-poverty programs,” declaring that “negroes” are “getting pretty uppity these days and that’s a problem for us since they’ve got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness….” and claimed further that his efforts would secure the vote of the “nig*ers” for “200 years.”<br><br>As noted in 2013 at the Washington Post:<br><br>“Nearly 50 years after the release of the U.S. Department of Labor report ‘The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,’ which was highly controversial and widely criticized at the time [as it was released at the time of the unveiling of the “Great Society”], the new Urban Institute study found that the alarming statistics in the report back then ‘have only grown worse, not only for blacks, but for whites and Hispanics as well.’”<br><br>Importantly, the man who most influenced the Great Society programs was the founder of the America’s largest Marxist organization “Democratic Socialists of America,” and a member of the Catholic Worker Movement, Michael Harrington. 4.) Bill Clinton<br><br>In 1992, Bill Clinton told the New York Times that it was a “mistake” for him to golf at an all-white country club and for good measure, further accused then-President George H.W. Bush and Republicans “of dividing the country racially.”<br><br>When Bill Clinton selected global warming fear monger Al Gore as his Vice President, it clearly did not bother him that Gore’s dad walked “arm-in-arm with other segregationist Democrats to kill the Civil Rights act of 1964.” Al Gore, Sr., it should be noted, had an FBI file back when the FBI maintained records on treasonous activities, as well as a benefactor in Soviet agent Armand Hammer. Al Gore, Sr. also was pivotal in getting Joe Biden into office. More on Joe Biden here. It further did not occur to Bill Clinton to distance himself from “notorious segregationist,” racist, pro-communist, and anti-Semitic “mentor” former Arkansas Sen. J. William Fulbright, who “was one of ninety-nine congressional Democrats to sign the Southern Manifesto, which declared that the Southern states had a right to keep their populations segregated by race.”<br><br>As an aside, the famous Fulbright fellowship has been recently renamed to the “J. William Fulbright – Hillary Rodham Clinton Fellowship.”<br><br>The Southern Manifesto, by the way, “was signed by 101 members of the U.S. Congress, including 19 senators and 82 members of the House of Representatives. Ninety-nine of them were Democrats.”<br><br>As reported at National Review, Bill Clinton was among “three state officials the NAACP sued in 1989 under the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965” for suppressing the black vote. Quoting the Arkansas Gazette from December 6, 1989, the article continues: “Plaintiffs offered plenty of proof of monolithic voting along racial lines, intimidation of black voters and candidates and other official acts that made voting harder for blacks…the evidence at the trial was indeed overwhelming that the Voting Rights Act had been violated…”<br><br>The article continues:<br><br>During his 12-year tenure, Governor Clinton never approved a state civil-rights law. However, he did issue birthday proclamations honoring Confederate leaders Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee. He also signed Act 116 in 1987. That statute reconfirmed that the star directly above the word ‘Arkansas’ in the state flag ‘is to commemorate the Confederate States of America.’ Arkansas also observed Confederate Flag Day every year Clinton served…<br><br>According to the book Game Change, as reported in an article at the NY Daily News, Bill Clinton was hoping for the late Ted Kennedy’s endorsement for his wife Hillary as President but Kennedy threw his support behind Obama, prompting Clinton to say, “the only reason you are endorsing him is because he’s black. Let’s just be clear.”<br><br>Clinton allegedly added,<br><br>A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee. 3.) Franklin Delano Roosevelt<br><br>FDR spoke at the 1924 Democrat National Convention, also known as the “Klanbake” (also see here, here and here) for the “heavy representation of Ku Klux Klan-friendly delegates,” as reported at the Wall Street Journal. According to Digital History, after the Klanbake, “some 20,000 Klan supporters wearing white hoods and robes held a picnic in New Jersey…”<br><br>While the name “Klanbake” is disputed, the immense KKK Presence at the 1924 DNC is not disputed, and in fact, an anti-KKK resolution was narrowly defeated, and while the GOP convention in Cleveland that year failed to pointedly denounce the Ku Klux Klan in their party platform, they did not have a pro-Ku Klux Klan resolution. The final vote at the DNC was 546.15 for the Klan, 542.85 against the Klan, according to an American magazine published in the early 20th century: “Review of Reviews and World’s Work: An International Magazine, Volume 70”. In addition to speaking at the Klanbake, Roosevelt appointed “confidant” James Byrnes to the Supreme Court, who was so powerful that he was known as the “assistant president on the home front” and who “believed in racial segregation… and worked to defeat anti-lynching bills introduced in Congress.”<br><br>Despite the fact that Byrnes was not elected by the people, FDR “assigned Byrnes more powers than ever held by a public official.”<br><br>Even worse, FDR appointed prominent Ku Klux Klan member Hugo Black to the Supreme Court. Black’s involvement in the KKK was confirmed by Pittsburgh Post-Gazette journalist Ray Sprigle, a journalist who won a “Pulitzer Prize for Reporting” for his exposé. As reported at Liberty Unyielding, the revelation was a massive scandal at the time. Franklin Delano Roosevelt additionally refused to meet with black Olympian Jesse Owens. As reported at the Daily Mail:<br><br>President Franklin Roosevelt never congratulated Owens or invited him to the White House. ‘Hitler didn’t snub me – it was FDR who snubbed me,’ Owens said. But all of the above offenses pale in comparison to Roosevelt’s Executive Order 9066, which “authorized the internment of tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese ancestry and resident aliens from Japan.” Some Germans and Italians were also interned. Expressing about his position on German and Italian Americans during World War II, Roosevelt stated “I don’t care so much about the Italians, they are a lot of opera singers, but the Germans are different. They may be dangerous.”<br><br>As an aside, in 1945, speaking of a Japanese soldier who lost his life defending America, then-Captain Ronald Reagan said,<br><br>Blood that has soaked into the sand of a beach is all one color. America stands unique in the world, the only country not founded on race, but on a way, an ideal. The Japanese faced discrimination even after they returned home by groups “such as the American Legion, Native Sons of the Gold West, and labor unions…”<br><br>Not surprisingly, FDR’s Supreme Court, including Hugo Black – who wrote the majority opinion) later found the civil rights horror to be Constitutional. Perhaps the Supreme Court is not infallible, after all. 2.) Woodrow Wilson<br><br>“It is untenable, in view of the established facts, to maintain that the segregation is simply to avoid race friction, for the simple reason that for fifty years white and colored clerks have been working together in peace and harmony and friendliness, doing so even through two Democratic administrations. Soon after your inauguration began, segregation was drastically introduced in the Treasury and Postal departments by your appointees.” (emphasis added) – Monroe Trotter to Woodrow Wilson, imploring him to stop rampant segregation in Wilson’s Administration<br><br>Leftist hero Woodrow Wilson may be glorified as a “leader of the progressive movement” on the federal government website; but this disturbed President was not only racist, he almost single-handedly brought about the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in America. As reported at Liberty Unyielding:<br><br>The Ku Klux Klan persecuted black Americans and their white Republican advocates, along with Catholics and Jewish people. The Ku Klux Klan enjoyed a ‘resurgence’ in 1915, thanks mainly to the film, “The Birth of a Nation,” which was based on Thomas Dixon’s ‘The Clansman.’ Thomas Dixon was a “longtime political supporter, friend and former classmate of [Woodrow] Wilson’s at Johns Hopkins University.”<br><br>Woodrow Wilson screened “The Birth of a Nation” in the White House. In fact, it was the very first film to ever be shown at the White House. Woodrow Wilson himself was quoted in the film from his own book: “A History of the American People.”<br><br>In his book, Wilson wrote:<br><br>“The white men of the South were aroused by the mere instinct of self-preservation to rid themselves, by fair means or foul, of the intolerable burden of governments sustained by the votes of ignorant negroes and conducted in the interest of adventurers.”<br><br>This is how it looked (modified) in the movie:<br><br>If one Googles “intolerable burden of governments sustained by the votes of ignorant negroes,” one is led right to the passage in Wilson’s book, where he continues to breathlessly glorify the Ku Klux Klan. Wilson was unsurprisingly a huge supporter of segregation and even<br><br>“…extended and defended segregation in the federal civil service. Black workers were forced to use inferior and segregated washrooms, and screens were set up to separate black and white workers in the same government offices.”<br><br>One quote by Woodrow Wilson not taught in history class:<br><br>Segregation is not a humiliation but a benefit, and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen. Woman’s Suffrage Leader Alice Stokes Paul would also take exception to the portrayal of Wilson as a civil rights leader. As reported at TavernKeepers.com:<br><br>“After Wilson ignored the Woman’s Suffrage movement, he was finally forced, as a stated ‘war measure’, and only after increasing pressure from Paul and the National Women’s Party, to promote the [Constitutional] amendment. After Democratic Senators filibustered to prevent a roll call, the amendment was finally passed [granting women the right to vote]. Ayes including 36 (82%) Republicans and 20 (54%) Democrats.”<br><br>This author would be remiss not to mention that Alice Stokes Paul and her allies were hard left agitators. In fact, Stokes Paul was prejudiced “particularly against African Americans and Jews.”<br><br>Ironically, the Democratic Party Website brazenly uses racist Democrat Woodrow Wilson as an example of Civil Rights. They state, “Under the leadership of Democratic President Woodrow Wilson, the U.S. Constitution was amended to grant women the right to vote.”<br><br>1). Barack Obama<br><br>Like FDR and LBJ, President Obama favored the insidious soul-crushing* (see quotes below) welfare programs that are detrimental to society as a whole, having a particular negative impact on Hispanic and black Americans (as noted in the 2014 “Welfare Indicators and Risk Factors” report from HHS: “recipiency and dependency rates are higher for Non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics of any race than they are for NonHispanic Whites.”)<br><br>Under Obama, food stamps doubled (Food Stamps also doubled under George W. Bush, from $17 billion to $38 billion, then doubled again under Obama, to $78 billion), CNS found that “38 percent of all children 5 and under in the United States were welfare recipients in 2011” (the latest year data is available from previously-mentioned HHS report), and as reported at Policy Mic, the welfare state under Obama grew faster than jobs were created. As observed at National Review Online, the culture of racial politics in the Obama Administration permeated other areas in the government. Members of the Black Caucus, for example, “now routinely either allege outright racism or exhibit racist attitudes themselves if opposition arises to the Obama agenda.”<br><br>Obama proved himself to be obsessed with skin color to the point of idiocy (same as his wife) – using identity politics ad nauseum to divide Americans seemingly in any way possible – not just by race, but by gender, sexual orientation, religion, wealth, and anything else that can be used to divide, confuse and polarize. A little-known fact about President Obama is that he is a believer in the Constitutionally abhorrent “disparate impact” legal theory, which basically ignores the root causes of racial disparities and instead seeks to remedy perceived wrongs after the fact. One example of this are the policies that led to the financial collapse in 2008. Read Neil Munro’s article at the Daily Caller to find out how Obama himself contributed to the financial collapse. But President Obama is easily the number one racist president because his obsession with skin color is a cover for something much more insidious. President Obama wants communist revolution. The author does not make this claim lightly. Throughout his life, Barack Obama has been surrounded by Communist Party members, Democrat Socialist of America activists and other assorted leftist radicals. Trevor Loudon, expert on socialist and radical movements and author of “Barack Obama and the Enemies Within,” was the first to make the connection with the Hawaiian Communist Frank Marshall Davis. Loudon also exposed former “Green Czar” Van Jones as a Communist working in the Obama Administration. Loudon said,<br><br>One thing all of these radical groups have in common is the relentless exploitation of racial and class divisions as a strategy employed to break down American social structure. But Obama was not only acquainted with Communist card carrying member Frank Marshall Davis; He is also deeply enmeshed with key advisers David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett, both of whom have family and professional ties to Communist Party USA. Obama also has been acquainted with radicals from:<br><br>- Democratic Socialists of America<br><br>- New Party/Progressive Chicago<br><br>- Communist Party USA<br><br>- Committees of Correspondence<br><br>- the Labor Movement<br><br>- ACORN & Project Vote<br><br>- Council for a Livable World<br><br>Former President Obama and those surrounding him carefully, deliberately and painstakingly degraded and dismantled the Constitution and the founding fathers at every turn; they attempted to marginalize and vilify patriotic individuals. Americans who understand the Constitution and the philosophy of limited government and self rule the only force standing in their path to the slow march to communism and global governance. * See the following quotes and learn from history:<br><br>“The lessons of history, confirmed by the evidence immediately before me, show conclusively that continued dependence upon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally to the national fibre. To dole out relief in this way is to administer a narcotic, a subtle destroyer of the human spirit. It is inimical to the dictates of sound policy. It is in violation of the traditions of America. Work must be found for able-bodied but destitute workers. The Federal Government must and shall quit this business of relief.” – FDR, Annual Message to Congress, January 4, 1935<br><br>“Because it is right, because it is wise, and because, for the first time in our history, it is possible to conquer poverty, I submit, for the consideration of the Congress and the country, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.” – Lyndon B. Johnson’s Special Message to Congress, March 16, 1964<br><br>The “…steady expansion of this welfare program [FDR’s Social Security Act of 1935], as of public assistance programs in general, can be taken as a measure of the steady disintegration of the Negro family structure over the past generation in the United States” – United States Department of Labor report published in March 1965","When Elizabeth Cady Stanton was penning the Declaration of Sentiments, she was imagining a future in which women had the right to own property and to vote, as well as the ability to participate in legislation. She was picturing a life in which women were viewed as equal to men, able to earn an income, able to speak their mind, and treated with respect. But in that vision, did Stanton see a world with abortion on demand? Did any of the major players in early feminism aim for such a thing? No, the early feminists fought for women’s rights, and they did not include abortion. The first feminists of the United States of America didn’t want what today’s liberal feminists spend their time fighting for — total and complete ‘reproductive freedom.’ They saw abortion for what it is: the oppression of women and children. Stanton said:<br><br>When we consider that women have been treated as property, it is degrading to women that we should treat our children as property to be disposed of as we see fit. In the February 5, 1868, issue of The Revolution, Stanton referred to the “murder of children, either before or after birth” as an “evil” which had become “frightfully prevalent.”<br><br>Along with Stanton, Elizabeth Blackwell, the first female doctor in the United States, spoke out against abortion. Concerning Madame Restell, a fellow female doctor who committed abortions, Blackwell said:<br><br>The gross perversion and destruction of motherhood by the abortionist filled me with indignation, and awakened active antagonism. That the honorable term ‘female physician’ should be exclusively applied to those women who carried on this shocking trade seemed to me a horror. It was an utter degradation of what might and should become a noble position for women. The thought of killing preborn children was a horrible one to our first feminists. They could never have foreseen that an act they considered “evil” and a “gross perversion and destruction of motherhood” would become the center-stage issue that it is today. So focused on abortion are the liberal feminists of the 21st century that politicians are beholden to the abortion industry, accepting money from groups like NARAL and Planned Parenthood in exchange for votes against even popular laws such as the banning of abortion after viability. So how did feminism lead us to today’s worship of abortion? Another early feminist, Susan B. Anthony, nailed it when she said:<br><br>All the articles on this subject [abortion] that I have read have been from men. They denounce women as alone guilty, and never include man in any plans for the remedy. . . Guilty? Yes. No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed [abortion]. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh, thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime! It would be men who would add abortion to feminism’s to-do list. In fact, even into the 1960s, the women’s movement remained focused on issues such as women’s right to education and equal pay. The so-called right to abortion was not a goal of feminists even 100 years after Stanton and other first feminists began the movement for women’s rights. Abortion did not take center stage until a few bad men stepped in and worked to convince the women’s movement to take on the pet issues of sexual revolution advocates — including contraception and abortion. Journalist Sue Ellen Browder’s book Subverted highlights how Lawrence Lader and abortionist Bernard Nathanson founded NARAL and concluded that they needed feminists on board with them if they wanted to get abortion legalized. After years of trying to persuade her, Lader convinced Betty Friedan to include abortion in her political platform despite the fact that Friedan was initially against abortion. Lader convinced Friedan and other women that they needed abortion in order to be truly equal. He did this by grossly exaggerating the number of women who were undergoing illegal abortions and how many of those women were dying from abortion. In order for the sexual revolution to “work,” men needed to avoid accountability, and the best way to remain uncommitted and unaccountable to women was to ensure that children were never born as a result of their sexual affairs. Over time, women became convinced that it was their children who were holding them back from accomplishing equality. Rather than celebrating the differences between men and women and the equality that exists within and in spite of those differences, women became convinced that they had to be the same as men. Men are never questioned about their ability to do their job because of the number of children they have. Men are not routinely told they cannot get a college degree and be a father at the same time. Men are not overlooked for a promotion because their wife is pregnant. No, it was and still remains women who are told that parenting does not allow for other goals, dreams, or accomplishments. It became common belief that if women wanted to be equal to men, they had to deny the basic and beautiful biological difference between the two sexes. They had to refuse life to their children. Today, over 70 percent of women who abort say they felt pressured to do so. That pressure comes from the men — and now fellow women, too — who convince these women they can never finish their education or continue their career with a child in tow. The pressure comes from boyfriends or husbands who threaten to leave them if they don’t have an abortion. The pressure comes from parents who threaten to kick a girl out on the streets because she has embarrassed their family. These pressures are overwhelming because women don’t feel they can raise a child alone. And yet, they can. True feminism shows them that. READ: What to do if your boyfriend – or anyone – wants you to get an abortion<br><br>While it is ideal for men and women to work together caring for children as a family, the sexual revolution hijacked the women’s movement and made it acceptable for men to walk away from their children. With abortion, women were made to feel that they should also walk away from their babies. Women often feel that abortion is their only choice, but it’s not. Many a strong modern woman has given life to her child, defying her circumstances. READ: I was scheduled to be aborted, but my mom had the strength to walk out<br><br>Freedom doesn’t come from your back being up against the wall. Abortion doesn’t mean equality. It isn’t synonymous with freedom. Abortion is oppression. Stanton, Blackwell, and Anthony knew it in the late 1800s and early 1900s. That’s why they never fought for it. That’s why they pointed it out as evil. That’s why they noticed that it was men who wanted abortion, not women. If men and women work together in complete and true equality, balancing each other’s strengths and reaching together for common goals, then women can experience true freedom, along with their children. Perhaps then, the goals of our first feminists can finally be obtained. READ: Pregnant and feeling alone? You’re not. Here’s where to get help","Once again Judicial Watch is doing the heavy lifting. Conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch released transcript of a court-ordered deposition of Jake Sullivan, Hillary Clinton’s senior advisor and deputy chief of staff when she was head of the Department of State. Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>In January, Judge Royce C. Lamberth ordered corrupt Obama and Hillary officials to provide answers, under oath, to Judicial Watch about Benghazi and Hillary Clinton’s private email server.

The material has subsequently been upclassified but at the time that I sent it, I did not believe that it was classified.”<br><br>Via Judicial Watch:<br><br>Sullivan said in the deposition that he had not been concerned about Clinton’s use of a non-government email account, because it was not part of his job:<br><br>Like Secretary Clinton has said herself, I wish she had used a State Department account. It wasn’t really part of my job to be thinking about Secretary Clinton’s emails so I don’t think I sort of fell down directly in my job, but do I wish I had thought of it during the time we were at State. Of course. I mean, what human being at this point wouldn’t have thought of that? Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>Sullivan’s deposition is part of United States District Judge Royce C. Lamberth’s order for senior officials — including Susan Rice, Ben Rhodes, Jacob Sullivan, and FBI official E.W. Priestap – to respond under oath to Judicial Watch questions.

The court denied release of the video depositions for now and left the door open for reconsideration. [T]he Court does not foreclose future releases of audiovisual recordings – in this or other cases. Judicial Watch may move to unseal portions of these recordings relied upon in future court filings. So too may it use the video recordings at trial, consistent with the Federal Rules of Evidence. “A federal court wants answers on the Clinton email scandal and Mr. Sullivan is one of many witnesses Judicial Watch will question under oath,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “It is shameful that the Justice and State Departments continue to try to protect Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration on the email scandal.”<br><br>Advertisement - story continues below<br><br>If not for Judicial Watch, Americans wouldn’t even know about Hillary Clinton’s use of a private server which she set up to avoid FOIA oversight of her Clinton Foundation pay-to-play while she was the head of the Department of State.

And then it was crazy.”<br><br>An individual with deadly intent was in the school building, holding an assault weapon that was designed for fighting wars. As Figueroa’s use of the term “code red” indicated, such an event is no longer considered an aberration. All across the country, school boards drill their teachers and students in how to respond to such an emergency. Code yellow: turn cell phones to silent, return to the classroom, and follow the teacher’s instructions. Code red: find a secure area immediately, lock the door, close the blinds, turn off the lights, do not move. This lockdown wasn’t a drill, of course. By the time it was over, seventeen people had been shot dead, and more than a dozen had been wounded. “Bodies were lying in the hallway,” another eyewitness told Fox News. “People were killed in the hallway.” Police later identified the suspected killer as Nikolas Cruz, a nineteen-year-old former student who had been expelled for discipline problems. After Cruz fled the scene—he was arrested shortly after the shooting, in neighboring Coral Springs—news helicopters captured footage of students walking and running from the school, some of them carrying flowers and cards. It was Valentine’s Day, after all. By that point, the authorities had secured the area around the school. There were heavily armed cops, police cars, bomb-squad trucks, and F.B.I. vehicles. The mayor of Parkland, a former teacher named Beam Furr, told CNN, “It’s all being fairly well coördinated, and everyone is doing everything they can.”<br><br>But were they? On Twitter, President Donald Trump offered his “prayers and condolences to the families of the victims,” adding that “no child, teacher, or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.” Fox News interviewed Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, who has an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. “I hope people reserve judgment.... The facts of this are important,” Rubio said. As soon as the facts are clear, Rubio went on, “we can have a deeper conversation about why these things happen.” The forty-six-year-old Republican added, “It’s a terrible situation. It’s amazing the amount of carnage that one individual can carry out in such a short period of time.”<br><br>Yet some pertinent facts are already known. According to local police, Cruz was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle—the same type of gun that Adam Lanza used to kill twenty-six pupils and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in December, 2012. Evidently, Rubio still isn’t aware of the power of such weapons, which fire bullets that can penetrate a steel helmet from a distance of five hundred yards. When fired from close range at civilians who aren’t wearing body armor, the bullets from an AR-15 don’t merely penetrate the human body—they tear it apart. It “looks like a grenade went off in there,” Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at the University of Arizona, told Wired. To spare the families of the victims—and the public at large—additional anguish, these sorts of details are often glossed over in the aftermath of mass shootings. But it’s surely long past time that we acknowledged these facts, and that we begin to more fully discuss the complicity of N.R.A.-backed politicians like Rubio, and Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, in maintaining the environment that allows these tragedies to happen again and again and again. One of the first duties of any government is to protect its citizens, through collective action, from violent threats they’d otherwise have to fend off themselves. Even most libertarians accept this principle. But when it comes to mass shootings, the Republican Party falls back on constitutional arguments that have no proper basis in history, and it refuses to budge from this stance. Nothing can shift it—not Sandy Hook, not the Orlando night-club shooting, not the Las Vegas massacre, not weekly shootings in schools. (According to the Guardian, Wednesday’s attack in Parkland was the eighth school shooting this year that has resulted in death or injury.) Nothing. The Democrats aren’t entirely blameless, either. In 2009 and 2010, when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, they failed to take some steps that were obviously necessary, such as closing the gun-show loophole for background checks and reinstating the Clinton Administration’s ban on assault weapons, which the Bush Administration allowed to expire. The Republicans bear the primary responsibility, though. Ever since Sandy Hook, it is their craven subservience to the gun lobby that has prevented meaningful action, even as the carnage that Rubio referred to has continued. “Turn on your televisions right now and you are going to see scenes of children running for their lives,” Chris Murphy, the junior Democratic senator for Connecticut, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon. “Let me just note once again for my colleagues: this happens nowhere else other than the United States of America. This epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting, it only happens here. Not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction. We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.”<br><br>The key concept in that excellent peroration was responsibility. Even with the blood of defenseless children flowing along the corridors of schoolhouses, the U.S. government has abdicated its duty to protect. And that, it bears repeating ad nauseum, is a national disgrace.","A Call to Arms at the Supreme Court<br><br>Conservative judges worry that the Second Amendment has become “a second-class right.”<br><br>A specter is haunting the Supreme Court — disrespect for the Second Amendment. Perhaps you haven’t realized that the Supreme Court’s disinclination to expand on its landmark 2008 decision creating an individual right to gun ownership means that the justices are treating the Second Amendment as a “second-class right.” A “watered-down right.” A “disfavored right.”<br><br>If you are unaware of these outlandish claims, then you haven’t tuned into the rising chorus of judicial voices demanding more from the Supreme Court than gun fanciers already won in that intensely disputed 5-to-4 decision a decade ago, District of Columbia v. Heller. Why is this happening, and why now? To understand why the “second-class right” meme is suddenly penetrating the judicial conversation, we have to begin with Justice Clarence Thomas. He is not the first member of the current Supreme Court to use the phrase; Justice Samuel Alito Jr. used it in his 2010 opinion that extended the analysis of the Heller decision, which had applied only to Washington, D.C., as a federal enclave, to the states. The court was being asked, Justice Alito wrote in McDonald v. City of Chicago, “to treat the right recognized in Heller as a second-class right,” which he said the court would not do. But it is Justice Thomas who has taken up the phrase as a weapon, using it in a series of opinions over the past four years to accuse his colleagues of failing in their duty to keep pushing back against limitations on gun ownership and use. The opinions were all dissents from the court’s decisions not to hear particular gun-rights appeals. In 2015, for example, he wrote that the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had been wrong to uphold an Illinois city’s ban on assault weapons, and that by refusing to hear the appeal, his colleagues had failed to “prevent the Seventh Circuit from relegating the Second Amendment to a second-class right.”<br><br>Last year, objecting to the court’s decision not to hear a challenge to California’s 10-day waiting period for gun purchases, Justice Thomas mused that “I suspect that four members of this court would vote to review a 10-day waiting period for abortions.” He declared, “The right to keep and bear arms is apparently this court’s constitutional orphan.”<br><br>In another opinion, this time joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Thomas said it was “indefensible” and “untenable” for the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit to have upheld California’s ban on carrying concealed weapons. By turning down the appeal, he wrote, the justices were enabling “the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.” And in a remarkable concluding paragraph to his eight-page opinion, he added:<br><br>“For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous. But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense. I do not think we should stand by idly while a state denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.”<br><br>By calling attention to Justice Thomas’s Second Amendment crusade, I want to make four points. First, he’s simply wrong. The court decided Heller to vindicate what the majority described as a “core” Second Amendment right — the right of an individual to keep a handgun at home for self-defense. That’s all. Whatever else the Second Amendment enables people to do with their guns was left open. As Justice Antonin Scalia observed in his majority opinion, “It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose.”<br><br>Maybe Justice Scalia included that and a few other disclaimers in order to stay within the comfort zone of a member of his narrowest of majorities, probably Justice Anthony M. Kennedy. Or maybe he was just kicking the can down the road. In any event, it’s certainly not the case that justices who decline to overturn a 10-day waiting period can be accurately labeled hypocrites who are content to hide in their marble palace while leaving the populace unprotected. Nor is the Second Amendment absolutism that Justice Thomas is calling for reflected in the way the Supreme Court interprets most other constitutional guarantees. Judge Bruce Selya of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit made this point in a majority opinion in November rejecting a challenge to a provision of the Massachusetts gun licensing statute. “Even though the Second Amendment right is fundamental,” Judge Selya, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his opinion for a unanimous panel, “the plaintiffs have offered us no valid reason to treat it more deferentially than other important constitutional rights.” That decision, Gould v. Morgan, will shortly be appealed to the Supreme Court. My second point is to underscore the role Justice Thomas plays in creating this rhetorical tidal wave. He is a Federalist Society icon and a hero to many young conservative lawyers, including the 10 former Thomas law clerks whom President Trump has already appointed to federal judgeships. (A dozen other former Thomas clerks hold important nonjudicial positions in the administration.) They and their colleagues among the new Trump judges, many of whom clerked for other conservative justices, are the ones who are making the “second-class right” mantra a standard feature of any Second Amendment dissent — in other words, not only that a particular majority opinion is incorrect, but that it is part of a dangerous trend that the Supreme Court, by implication if not explicitly, needs to address right now. For example, the full 15-member Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit recently refused to reconsider a decision by a three-judge panel to uphold the longstanding federal ban on interstate sales of handguns. Dissenting from that refusal, Judge James C. Ho, a former Thomas clerk who joined the Fifth Circuit last year, cited Justice Thomas’s opinions in observing, “Yet the Second Amendment continues to be treated as a ‘second-class’ right.”<br><br>His dissent included a subtle dig at Chief Justice John Roberts, who notably has not joined Justice Thomas’s Second Amendment choir. The government rationale for the ban on interstate handgun sales is that while federally licensed firearm dealers can be expected to know the laws of their own state, they may not be familiar with laws of other states and so may not know whether an out-of-state purchaser is legally entitled to own a gun. That is not sufficient justification for the ban, Judge Ho wrote; if dealers could learn their own state’s laws, they could learn other states’ laws as well. “Put simply, the way to require compliance with state handgun laws is to require compliance with state handgun laws,” he wrote in a riff on the chief justice’s much-discussed line in a 2007 school integration case: “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”<br><br>Judge Ho’s Fifth Circuit colleague Don R. Willett, another new member of the court, observed in his own dissenting opinion in the same case, “The Second Amendment is neither second class, nor second rate, nor second tier.” An appeal in that case, Mance v. Whitaker, is now pending at the Supreme Court, and the justices will decide this month or next whether to accept it. Another new judge, Stephanos Bibas, dissented last month from a decision by a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit that upheld a New Jersey law limiting a firearm magazine to 10 rounds of ammunition. He said the state had failed to provide sufficient evidence that “specifically links large magazines to mass-shooting deaths.” Acknowledging that five other federal circuit courts have also upheld limits on magazine sizes, Judge Bibas observed that while judges were understandably concerned about gun violence, “they err in subjecting the Second Amendment to different, watered-down rules and demanding little if any proof.”<br><br>“The Second Amendment is an equal part of the Bill of Rights,” Judge Bibas wrote. “We may not water it down and balance it away based on our own sense of wise policy.” That case is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. The New Jersey affiliate of the National Rifle Association, which brought the case, is first seeking review by the full Third Circuit. The 49-year-old Judge Bibas, a former law professor, won plaudits for his dissenting opinion. “It is easy to see why President Trump chose to appoint him,” said an article on the website ammoland.com that appeared under the headline: “Third Circuit: Second Amendment Is a Second Rate Right.” John O. McGinnis, a well-known conservative professor at Northwestern University Law School, writing on the Law and Liberty website, called Judge Bibas’s dissent “the judicial equivalent of a perfect game, a first-round knockout, or a checkmate within 10 moves.” He added, “It will not be the last opinion of the Trump appellate judges that will shake the judiciary from its dogmatic slumber.”<br><br>My third point is this: Professor McGinniss may well be right, at least when it comes to the Second Amendment. The substitution of Brett Kavanaugh for Justice Kennedy may do the trick. On his former court, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, Justice Kavanaugh took an aggressive gun-rights position, dissenting in 2011 from a decision that upheld the district’s ban on certain assault rifles. Calling the majority’s analytical approach to the case “especially inappropriate,” then-Judge Kavanaugh wrote: “A ban on a class of arms is not an ‘incidental’ regulation. It is equivalent to a ban on a category of speech.” As a matter of constitutional doctrine, I understand his argument: that a right deemed by the Supreme Court to be fundamental, whether under the First Amendment or the Second, is entitled to the highest level of judicial protection. Nonetheless, to analogize possession of assault rifles to the right to free speech is a provocative move. The two conservative judges who made up the majority on the three-judge panel, Douglas Ginsburg and Karen LeCraft Henderson, were sufficiently provoked by Judge Kavanaugh’s 52-page dissent that they added to their own opinion an unusual six-page “appendix” for the specific purpose of contesting his arguments. “The dissent mischaracterizes the question before us,” Judge Ginsburg wrote for himself and Judge Henderson. “We simply do not read Heller as foreclosing every ban on every possible sub-class of handguns or, for that matter, a ban on a sub-class of rifles.”<br><br>Justice Thomas himself has cited Judge Kavanaugh’s dissenting opinion favorably. It would hardly be surprising for Justice Kavanaugh to return the favor and join the crusade. And that brings me to my final point. The Supreme Court’s appetite for expanding the Second Amendment, if such an appetite develops, will be wildly out of sync with the mood of the country. As The Times reported last month, based on data compiled by a gun-control advocacy group, public support for gun-control measures is surging. State legislatures passed 69 gun-control measures in 2018, more than three times the number in the previous year. More than half the states enacted at least one, while 90 percent of bills the National Rifle Association backed at the state level were defeated. Even the Trump administration has caught the trend, with its announcement last month of a ban on bump stocks, the cheap attachments that turn ordinary rifles into something close to machine guns and that the Las Vegas killer used to commit mass murder a year ago. The ban, to take effect in March, has already drawn at least two lawsuits. Perhaps these lawsuits will be a step too far even for the Second Amendment newbies on the federal bench. Or maybe not. Does it matter if the public and the Supreme Court are running in opposite directions? It’s good news to anyone who would like to accelerate the collapse of public confidence in the one organ of government that at the moment seems to stand between us and disaster. For the rest of us, it’s one more thing to worry about as the new year begins.

Jefferson Davis and his legacy departed Kentucky's Capitol Rotunda after a 12-foot marble statue commemorating the lone president of the Confederate States of America was removed from its base Saturday morning. Workers assembled a rig that lifted the 5-ton marble sculpture off the pedestal where it stood for 84 years — just a few feet behind the bronze statue of fellow Kentuckian Abraham Lincoln. Gov. Andy Beshear, who joined workers in the Rotunda on Saturday, said the monument represented a divisive symbol in Kentucky. ""After calling for its removal and urging the Historic Properties Advisory Commission to act, today I pressed the button to bring it down,"" Beshear tweeted. ""Now, every child who walks into their Capitol feels welcome. Today we took a step forward for the betterment of every single Kentuckian."" Davis, a Fairview native, was born June 3, 1808. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1828 before serving in the Mexican-American War. He later was a U.S. senator from Mississippi. But he was also traitor to the country and an ardent racist who fiercely defended slavery and opposed civil rights for African Americans after the Confederacy was defeated. ""Today is a symbol we are moving ahead,"" state Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Louisville, told The Courier Journal on Saturday. ""It's a recognition of the sins of our past."" Joe Gerth:Jefferson Davis represented what is wrong with our country<br><br>Nemes, a lawyer, brought his son to the Capitol to witness the statue's removal. He said he was shocked when he first saw the statue in the Rotunda during his bar association swearing-in ceremony years ago. ""We honor our history — the good and the bad — but in this room is what we want to celebrate,"" Nemes said. ""And I think it's a wonderful thing that we don't want to celebrate Jeff Davis anymore."" Calls to remove Davis from the Rotunda, where thousands of tourists visit each year, have been made for years by Republican and Democratic leaders in the state. But demands that the statue be removed intensified in recent weeks, as large protests in Louisville and throughout Kentucky developed over the death of Breonna Taylor, an unarmed Black woman shot eight times in her home by Louisville police officers. Those demonstrations over police brutality against Black Americans proliferated around the country after the May 25 killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis, with the movement adding the removal of Confederate monuments to its list of demands. Protesters in Richmond, Virginia, this week toppled a Davis statue, which had stood along the city's Monument Avenue since 1907. Beshear, a Democrat, nudged the Historic Properties Advisory Commission to hold a special meeting, which it did Friday. The panel voted to remove the Davis statue by an 11-1 vote. Related:Ben Chandler, whose grandfather put Davis in the Capitol, says it should go<br><br>The approved motion also called for moving the statue to the Jefferson Davis Monument State Historic Site in Todd County, where the Confederate leader was born. Davis was placed in the Rotunda at the urging of the United Daughters of the Confederacy in 1936. Cathy Thomas, who was appointed to the historic properties panel by Beshear in January, argued for the removal of the Davis statue during Friday's meeting. She said it was placed in the Rotunda during the Jim Crow era to reaffirm white supremacy, amid threats of lynchings and segregation that were prevalent at the time. ""He enslaved human beings, he rebelled against the United States of America,"" Thomas, who is Black, told the commission. ""He is a symbol of the Confederacy that might still have me in chains."" Some on the panel, however, argued that the removal represented an effort to appease a ""cultural movement"" that would lead to purging other historical figures. ""I believe Gov. Beshear is politicizing this as a weapon, using our board as a weapon to get his agenda over,"" said Brandon Wilson, who was appointed to the commission by former Gov. Matt Bevin. Wilson, the lone vote against removal, attempted a motion on Friday to remove all statues, including Lincoln, from the Capitol building. The effort was ruled out of order. For subscribers:Why protests prompted a Black LMPD officer to hand in his badge<br><br>Jon Park, who was also appointed to the panel by Bevin, said he was casting a ""reluctant"" vote in favor of removal. He said how he was torn by the decision and didn't want to open a ""Pandora's Box"" that could lead to the removal of other statues. Park, who works for Attorney General Daniel Cameron, said the former Confederacy president's entire life should not be forgotten. ""His early history, he was the things that were on that plaque that was removed by this commission — hero, statesman, patriot — he was those things,"" Park said. ""He took a bad career choice. He did something he shouldn't have done."" But biographers and historians have long described the Fairview native, who operated a large cotton plantation in Mississippi where he owned as many as 113 slaves, as a fierce defender of keeping Black people in bondage for much of his life. Davis was a champion of expanding slavery into other territories. As a U.S. senator in 1848, he proposed an amendment seeking to annex a part of Mexico where many southerners at the time wanted to expand slavery. He also favored the U.S. seizing Cuba to ""increase the number of slaveholding constituencies."" Three years before the Civil War, he threatened secession if a Republican were elected president. And when Mississippi seceded from the Union in 1861, Davis resigned from the Senate in protest and delivered a farewell speech defending slavery. ""African slavery, as it exists in the United States, is a moral, a social and a political blessing,"" Davis once said. Davis was eventually captured after the Civil War and was charged with treason, but he was later pardoned by President Andrew Johnson. He died in New Orleans in 1889. See also:From civil rights to BLM, Louisville's aging activists still protesting<br><br>Years after the war had ended he refused to take the oath of allegiance that many former Confederate soldiers and officials had made to regain their citizenship. Davis' U.S. citizenship was restored posthumously by Congress in 1978. A previous effort to remove the Davis statue — spurred by white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 — was rebuffed by the Historic Properties Advisory Commission in 2018, when it instead voted only to remove a plaque on it calling Davis a ""war hero."" Bevin, as a candidate for governor in 2015, said he supported removing the marble sculpture, only to later oppose it as governor, saying it would be a ""sanitization of history."" The commission also voted 7-2 to keep the Davis statue in 2015, the same year that a poll showed 73% of Kentuckians favored keeping it in the Rotunda. But there was bipartisan agreement to remove the statue in 2020 amid the national calls to sack Confederate monuments. ""He's gone, y'all,"" state Rep Derrick Graham, D-Frankfort, who is Black, said in a tweet. ""Glory, Hallelujah! Louisville resident Terry Wilson, 40, held a large green neon sign outside the Governor's Mansion on Saturday saying, ""Good job Andy."" Check out:Murray State's Morant asks for removal of Confederate statue in Kentucky<br><br>At one point the governor stepped outside the mansion's second-floor balcony to wave back. Wilson, who is Black, said it was hard as a child to understand why Kentucky had a statue honoring Davis. ""It had no place there,"" he said. ""Is that a goal for someone to be a Confederate president? That's not a goal worth celebrating or for someone to walk into the Capitol and see."" Cameron, a Republican who is the state's first Black attorney general, released a statement applauding the decision to relocate the Jefferson Davis statue. ""This decision reflects the current values (and) ideals of our commonwealth (and) signals to all who enter our capitol that we are committed to moving forward together."" State Sen. Chris McDaniel, R-Taylor Mill, prefiled legislation that would have removed the Davis statue if the commission failed to act. It also seeks to appropriate $500,000 to replace it with one of Carl Brashear, an African American Kentuckian depicted in the 2000 film ""Men of Honor"" who was a celebrated U.S. Navy master diver. Beshear said earlier in the week that he wanted a ""robust discussion"" over what would replace the Davis statue, though he called Brashear ""an amazing Kentuckian and obviously someone worthy of conversation about having their statue there."" Nemes, the Republican legislator, said he would like to see more diversity in the Rotunda, but that Kentuckians should take in the moment and revel in Saturday's removal. ""I'm very proud to be in the party of Lincoln,"" he said. ""I think we faltered in our history and my party, and as a nation. But I'm very proud to be here looking at Lincoln standing alone, if you will, without Jeff Davis over his shoulder.""

(Keyser was married for about ten years to Bob Beckel)","Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm behind the Trump dossier, turned over thousands of pages of documents to the Senate Judiciary Committee late Wednesday, The Daily Caller is told. But the documents do not appear to be what the committee was hoping that Fusion GPS and its founder, Glenn Simpson, would provide. “The committee is reviewing the production received late this afternoon from Mr. Simpson, but virtually all of the documents appear to be merely news clippings rather than records of Fusion’s substantive communications,” George Hartmann, a spokesman for the Senate Judiciary Committee, told TheDC. The paltry document production escalates the standoff between Fusion GPS and the Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley. After Simpson declined an invitation to testify before the committee last month, Grassley issued a subpoena to compel him to appear. But the subpoena was withdrawn after Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said he would voluntarily meet in a closed session with committee staff. A date for that meeting has not been set. Last month, the committee requested records from Fusion GPS, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr. and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the election. The Trump campaign gave the committee 20,000 pages of records last week while Trump Jr. and Manafort produced 250 pages and 400 pages of records, respectively. [dcquiz]<br><br>The committee is one of three congressional panels investigating Russia-related matters, including the dossier and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting held between Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney linked to Fusion GPS. In its request to Fusion, the Judiciary Committee asked for contracts that the firm signed for its work on the dossier. Fusion was initially hired to investigate Trump in Sept. 2015 by an unidentified Republican donor who opposed the real estate mogul. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor dropped the project. But Fusion soon found a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton’s — also still unidentified — to continue the research. Fusion hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to conduct the investigation. Fusion and Steele’s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, have worked together on various projects since 2010. The committee also asked Fusion to produce contracts and communications regarding its work against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Russian government. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended the Trump Tower meeting, was involved in the same lobbying campaign. Veselnitskaya represents Denis Katsyv, the chairman of Prevezon Holdings. Fusion GPS was working for BakerHostetler, a law firm that was also representing Katsyv and Prevezon. Veselnitskaya was accompanied to the Trump Tower meeting by Rinat Akhmetshin, a former Soviet military officer who works in the same line of business as Fusion GPS, providing political and business research for shadowy clients. The Judiciary Committee is also inquiring whether Fusion and Akhmetshin have done business together in the past. The strange overlap between Fusion GPS, the dossier, and the Trump Tower meeting has piqued Grassley’s interest. He has sought to find out who exactly was paying Fusion GPS for all of its projects. Grassley is interested in the dossier because of its importance to the FBI’s collusion investigation. The bureau has reportedly used information from the dossier as part of the basis for its probe. The dossier was reportedly used to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Page, an energy consultant, is named in the dossier as one of the Trump campaign’s liaisons to the Kremlin. Page has dismissed the claims. He refers to Steele’s document as “the dodgy dossier.”<br><br>Grassley has also questioned the FBI over whether it paid Steele to investigate Trump. FBI agents reportedly made an informal agreement with Steele in October to pay the former spy $50,000 to continue his investigation. That payment was reportedly never made.","It bears noting that since the Hillary election debacle, Huma has become extremely reckless in her associations. Huma Abedin has been raising a lot of eyebrows this month. The wife of the Sinaloa cartel’s El Chapo Guzman has been a frequent guest at her home. Interesting that this is coming out now and not under the corrupt James Comey and Trump-hater Andrew McCabe’s investigation. The endless lying and contempt for rule of law by this traitorous criminal gang cannot go unpunished. They broke the law. They are not above it. BREAKING NEWS: Jailed pervert Anthony Weiner had CLASSIFIED emails belonging to wife Huma Abedin on his laptop – which the FBI seized after he sexted 15-year-old girl The FBI found 2,800 of Huma Abedin’s work-related emails and documents on disgraced husband Anthony Weiner’s computer Weiner turned over the laptop to authorities as they investigated him in a teen sexting case Judicial Watch had sued for the materials, and the State Department said in September that it expected to have them processed by year’s end Government lawyers had to examine the files for classified material that the public can’t see – the same things that it’s illegal to keep on unsecured systems They found five classified emails about delicate talks with Middle East leaders including some from Israel, Hamas, Saudi Arabia and the Palestinian Authority By David Martosko, Us Political Editor For Dailymail.com, 29 December 2017: At least five emails determined to be classified were found among 2,800 documents stored on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner, whose then-wife Huma Abedin was deputy chief of staff to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The State Department released hundreds of pages of materials Friday afternoon, including a total of eight pages classified at the ‘confidential level,’ the third most sensitive level the U.S. government uses. The emails date from 2010, 2011 and 2012 and concern discussions with Middle East leaders including some from Israel, the United Arab Emirates, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. Large portions, including entire pages, were redacted before the documents’ release. Three of them were sent either to or from an address called ‘BBB Backup,’ which one email identifies as a backup of a Blackberry Bold 9700, presumably belonging to Abedin. Court documents in a case between Judicial Watch and the State Department revealed that Huma Abedin (pictured today with son Jordan in New York City) had had 2,800 work-related emails saved on her estranged husband Anthony Weiner’s laptop computer, and the documents include some classified emails This is page 1 of a four-page classified document found on Weiner’s computer; it was a ‘call sheet’ meant to guide Hillary Clinton through a sensitive phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu One page of a document released Friday is heavily redacted and marked ‘classified’; it mentions ‘update on Hamas-PA talks,’ referring to the Palestinian Authority. Another is a four-page ‘call sheet’ meant to guide Clinton through a sensitive phone call with Benjamin Netanyahu. A third is a detailed rundown of issues Clinton was expecting to address during a call with Saud bin Faisal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who served as Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister until 2015. Only one small portion of that email was deemed classified by intelligence agencies that reviewed it before releasing it to the public. The call sheet itself related mostly to the expected publication of a massive trove of U.S. diplomatic cables by the WikiLeaks organization. ‘This appears to be the result of an illegal act in which a fully cleared intelligence officer stole information and gave it to a website. The person responsible will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,’ the call sheet advised her to say. The then-secretary of state was warning the Saudis about impending leaks of ‘details of private conversations with your government on Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.’ The work-related emails and other documents were recovered from Weiner’s computer last year by the FBI.",2.79,1.7999999999999998,1.1,4.21,2.2,1.9,0.358,0.3999999999999999,0.10000000000000009,0.0299640306122449,0.0495,0.058055555555555555

A couple of days ago, it was revealedin the ongoing investigation that it was Hillary Clinton that paid for the dirty, dishonest dossier on Trump (created by …get this, the Russians). Now we know why the media is not covering this blockbuster story apart from their notorious leftwing bias – these corrupt misanthropes were being paid to spread the filth. Remember, this was not opposition research. Opposition research is based on fact, from voting records, court records and public statements, to tax returns and business relationships. Fusion GPS’s dossier, on the other hand, was misinformation. It was not opposition research because it was not based on fact. According to multiple media reports, beyond an alphabet soup of unnamed Russian intelligence sources and spreading hearsay, the material is largely drawn from news clips and Google internet search materials and left-wing conspiracy sites. Given Fusion GPS’s dependence on Russian gossip spread by Vladimir Putin’s spies, there is a good case to be made that Fusion GPS more deeply colluded with the Russians than anyone else. (he Hill:) Paying journalists to run defamation and libel is not protected under the First Amendment. And if anyone colluded with the Russians – it was Hillary and Fusion… and the press. Rep. Devin Nunes (right), chairman of the House Permanent Select committee on intelligence, has widened the net in the panel’s investigation into funding of a Russia dossier against Donald Trump. He now wants the names of journalists and law firms … more > The role of reporters is taking on added importance in federal court battles over the infamous Russia dossier that leveled unverified charges of collusion against the Donald Trump campaign. In U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Fusion GPS, the dossier’s financier via the Democratic Party and the Hillary Clinton campaign money, is fighting a House committee chairman’s bid to find out if the opposition research firm paid journalists. In U.S. District Court in Florida, a self-described dossier victim wants a judge to order the news website BuzzFeed, which published the dossier in full, to disclose who gave it to them. The cases underscore how a Moscow-sourced memorandum created as opposition research against Donald Trump in the presidential campaign last year often dictates the debate about politics and reporters’ rights in Washington. Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, signed a subpoena to force a bank to turn over Fusion’s financial records. He wants to know who paid for the dossier, which was written in a series of 18 memos by former British spy Christopher Steele. He relied almost exclusively on unidentified Kremlin sources. Fusion went to federal court to block the move, but the law firm Perkins Coie LLP, whose partner Marc E. Elias is the Clinton’s campaign’s general counsel, intervened. It filed a letter acknowledging it had paid Fusion for the dossier on behalf of Democrats. Fusion and Mr. Nunes then worked out an agreement on access to some of the firm’s financial records. But the dispute heightened again Friday as Fusion renewed its request for a judge to block the subpoena because Mr. Nunes wants more information. The widened net includes the names of journalists and law firms that Fusion might have paid. “It is contrived to substitute for the ridiculous notion that Intervenor [the House committee] can demand documents in an overbroad subpoena from a third party and not explain what it is looking for or why,” said a memorandum filed by Fusion’s law firm, Zuckerman Spaeder LLP, for U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan. On the demand for information on any payments to journalists, Fusion cited First Amendment protection and confidentiality. It did not deny it had paid journalists. “And they are not pertinent, as they are not related to Russia or Donald Trump,” Fusion argues. “In attempting to justify the overbroad subpoena earlier, Intervenor could have, but of course did not, argue the relevance to its inquiry of any such payments.” In the court battle with Mr. Nunes, Fusion has likened itself to a group of journalists with all associated rights. Its founders include former Wall Street Journal reporters Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch. Mr. Fritsch filed a declaration, saying: “Our techniques and investigative tools for our research and investigation go beyond standard open-source methods. Fusion GPS has an extensive network of domestic and international contacts, built up over many years of reporting.” In Florida, Russian technology entrepreneur Aleksej Gubarev, chief of Internet-platform provider XBT Holding, is suing BuzzFeed for libel. The Steele dossier accused Mr. Gubarev of overseeing a botnet operation that flooded Democrats’ computers with porn, viruses and spyware. It said the operation was financed by the FSB, Russia’s intelligence agency. Mr. Steele has acknowledged in a London libel case brought by Mr. Gubarev that he never confirmed the information and just passed it along to Fusion GPS as his final memo in December. Sources of controversy Fusion, which briefed a number of Washington reporters on Mr. Steele’s unverified assertions, has said it was not the source of BuzzFeed’s copy. Mr. Gubarev’s attorneys are trying to find out who was and whether that person warned the editors that the document was not verified. “And as you might imagine, if you are an online storage company, to have the accusation that you are an FSB agent — former KGB, now FSB — that you are essentially co-opted by the FSB and you are launching hacking against the Democratic Party, doesn’t do wonders for your business,” attorney Evan Fray-Witzer argued at a September hearing. He added: “There is only one way to know what the motivation was in giving the document and what was said to BuzzFeed when they received the document.” Katherine M. Bolger, BuzzFeed’s attorney, said various states protect source confidentiality through so-called shield laws. What’s more, since the dossier was the subject of a federal investigation when it was posted in January, BuzzFeed had complete legal freedom to report on it whether true or not, she argued. “If the United States government is investigating allegations, the press is free to report on them, period,” Ms. Bolger said. Ms. Bolger is demanding XBT data to determine if any of the Russian hacking on the Democrats went through the company’s servers. A federal judge’s ruling is expected this month. BuzzFeed has filed requests with federal agencies for documents detailing the FBI’s dossier handling. In his London court filing, Mr. Steele told of how he traveled to Washington at Fusion’s request and briefed Washington reporters in September during the campaign. He said through his attorneys that he gave explicit instructions that the information from Kremlin sources must be verified and that they should not quote the dossier. “The second defendant [Mr. Steele] understood that the information provided might be used for the purpose of further research but would not be published or attributed,” the filing stated. “None of the journalists raised any objections.” Yet, after the briefing, some of Mr. Steele’s claims did surface in press reports and Democratic talking points to buttress the charge that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow to interfere in the election. The McCain connection Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, Arizona Republican, is one person known to have possessed a dossier hard copy through a complex set of maneuvers with Mr. Steele. The senator ended up handing a copy to then-FBI Director James B. Comey weeks after the election when Mr. Trump was president-elect. A chronology of events would indicate that Mr. Comey had acquired the copy, during the election campaign, from a source not yet identified publicly. Mr. McCain denied being BuzzFeed’s source. “I gave it to no one except for the director of the FBI. I don’t know why you’re digging this up now,” Mr. McCain told The Daily Caller last month. The Steele court document, which was filed in the Florida case last month, detailed how Mr. McCain acquired the copy. A business associate of Mr. Steele’s — Andrew Wood, a former British ambassador to Moscow — informed the senator of its existence. Mr. McCain then dispatched an aide, David Kramer, to Surrey, England, to meet with Mr. Steele on Nov. 28. Mr. Kramer is a former State Department assistant secretary and scholar at Mr. McCain’s think tank in Arizona. Sometime later, Mr. Steele sent the dossier in a secure mode to the senator, who hand-delivered it to Mr. Comey. He later provided his last memo, in December, to Mr. McCain, Fusion GPS and the United Kingdom government. Here is how Mr. Steele described the handoff in his latest court filing: “The defendants [Mr. Steele, Orbis Business Intelligence] understood that the contents of the memoranda would be treated in the strictest confidence and would only be used by Senator McCain in his official capacity for the sole purpose of analyzing, investigating and verifying their contents to enable such action to be taken as necessary for the purposes of protecting US national security. “[Mr. Steele] expressly informed Mr. Kramer that the pre-election memoranda were only to be used for this exclusive purpose before he showed Mr. Kramer any of the memoranda. Mr. Kramer was not at this time provided with copies of the memoranda that had been prepared as at that date, but was shown copies.” A Washington Times analysis of Mr. Steele’s core charges against individuals such as Mr. Trump and Mr. Gubarev show that none has been confirmed publicly by any government investigation.","Tucker Carlson: America is now one nation with two very different justice systems<br><br>The people in power crack down on their enemies and give their allies a soft landing<br><br>The ironically-named ""Civil Rights Division"" of the Biden Justice Department announced Wednesday there will be no charges brought against the man who shot and killed protester Ashli Babbitt in the Capitol back in January. No one who pays attention was surprised to hear this. In cases like this, the benefit of the doubt usually does goes to law enforcement, and as we’ve often said, we’re fine with that. It should. But still, in a free society, the rest of us have a right to know roughly what happened. In this case, who shot Ashli Babbitt and why? No one will tell us. The Biden administration says the man who killed Babbitt is a Capitol Hill police officer, and he did the right thing. That’s all they’ve said. We know that Ashli Babbitt was short, female and unarmed. There’s no evidence the officer who killed her gave any kind of verbal warming before he pulled the trigger. Is that standard procedure? We’d imagined the rules of engagement for federal agents limited the use of deadly force to situations where law enforcement has reason to believe they or the people around them are in imminent danger of being harmed. You can’t just shoot people without warning because they’re in the wrong place. That’s not allowed. Except now, apparently, it is allowed. When did these rules change? And, once again, who exactly shot Ashli Babbitt? Journalists exist to ask questions like these, but they’re not. The Washington Post wrote a long story about the DOJ’s announcement in the case and never raised a single one of these questions. The Post didn’t name the shooter or even acknowledge that the government is withholding his name. CAPITOL RIOT: POLICE OFFICER WON'T FACE CHARGES IN FATAL SHOOTING OF ASHLI BABBITT, PROSECUTORS SAY<br><br>""Authorities determined that there was insufficient evidence to prove Babbitt’s civil rights were violated,"" the Post declared. That was it. The rest of the piece was a personal attack on Ashli Babbitt and her political views. She deserved to die. That was the point of the Washington Post story. How amazing to read something like this, especially now. Eleven hundred miles from Washington, in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, a police officer accidentally reached for her gun instead of a Taser and killed a man called Daunte Wright. It was a tragedy, as all shootings are. But we know that officer’s name because every news organization in the country printed it immediately. She has now resigned and is facing charges. Her mugshot is all over the Internet. Two nights ago, a mob showed up at her house, forcing her to flee. She’s not the only one. Last August, a police officer in Kenosha, Wisconsin shot a man called Jacob Blake. Remember that? Riots erupted immediately. Yesterday, that officer was cleared of all charges. When that story broke, NPR put that police officer’s name and photograph on the front of their website. So that’s the standard, except in this case where they are still hiding the identity of the man who shot Ashli Babbitt. EX-MINNESOTA POLICE OFFICER KIM POTTER RELEASED FROM JAIL AFTER POSTING $100G BOND<br><br>Sensing a theme here? The standards that big news organizations use to cover shootings depend entirely on the political views of the people who get shot. When The Washington Post doesn’t like the candidates you vote for, they suppress the details of the case. In the case of Ashli Babbitt, we’d know next to nothing about how she died, and we wouldn’t know anything if her shooting hadn’t been captured on video by people who don’t work at the Washington Post. One of those people is a video editor from Texas called Samuel Montyoa. Montoya was in the U.S. Capitol that day. Montoya doesn’t look much like a White supremacist, and he has no criminal history that we’re aware of. On Jan. 6, Samuel Montoya took what may be the clearest video of Ashli Babbitt's death:<br><br>When you watch the video, there are a lot of things to notice. Ashli Babbitt had no weapon. She wasn't attacking anyone. She couldn’t attack anyone, because she was climbing through a window at the moment she was shot. But what’s most striking is that several Capitol Hill police officers in paramilitary gear were standing directly behind Babbitt when she was killed. They were carrying what Joe Biden refers to as weapons of war — loaded AR-15s. So tell us again how Ashli Babbitt posed an imminent physical threat to anyone when she was shot. She didn’t. Samuel Montoya's footage proves it. And we’re grateful we have that tape. If we didn’t, The New York Times would be telling us that Ashli Babbitt was beating people to death with a fire extinguisher when she was killed. Thanks to Samuel Montoya, the New York Times can’t claim that. We’d love to have Montoya on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" to describe what he saw that day, but we can’t do that, because he’s in jail. Yesterday, a large group of armed federal agents showed up at his house in Austin. They smashed Montoya’s front door, confiscated his electronic devices and threw him in jail. He’s behind bars right now. What was his crime? Well, to find out, we read the Biden administration’s arrest warrant application. The FBI says it began investigating Montoya after one of his family members provided ""proof that Montoya was physically inside the U.S. Capital near the shooting of a woman on January 6, 2021."" To be clear, Montoya didn’t shoot the woman. He just happened to be nearby. AOC-LINKED GROUP BACKS 'DEFUND THE POLICE' ADVOCATE IN NY PRIMARY<br><br>But wait a second. Weren't there plenty of journalists inside the Capitol on Jan. 6? According to CNN, yes there were. CNN ran a piece telling us that, ""Congressional reporters became the country's eyes and ears as rioters stormed Capitol Hill."" So why hasn’t the FBI arrested the people CNN identified in its story — the photographers from Getty, the political reporters from NBC, the congressional correspondents from CNN and the AP? Well, that’s a good question. The FBI explains why in the warrant affidavit. ""At times during the video, Montoya describes himself to others inside the Capitol Building as a ‘reporter’ or ‘journalist’ as he attempts to get through crowds."" And yet, the FBI concludes, ""The director of the Congressional press galleries within the Senate Press office did a name check on Samuel Christopher Montoya and confirmed that no one by that name has Congressional press credentials as an individual, or via any other organizations."" So that’s the standard. If the U.S. Congress’s credentialing office says that you’re not a journalist, you’re not a journalist. Did Samuel Montoya have strong personal political views? Apparently he did. But you may have noticed that’s not so unusual in journalism right now. So why is journalist Samuel Montoya behind bars tonight? Well, he committed a crime? ""Interfering with government business."" In other words, trespassing. If this happened in Ukraine, what are the chances NBC News would describe Samuel Montoya as a ""dissident journalist,"" and then describe Ashli Babbitt an ""unarmed pro-democracy demonstrator""? The chances are roughly 100%. But this is America, and they’re not saying that. Instead they're telling us that Ashli Babbitt deserved to die. LAWRENCE JONES: LEFT TRYING TO 'BLOW UP OUR CURRENT STATE OF POLICING'<br><br>JOY REID, MSNBC: She embraced conspiracy theories. Her name was Ashli Babbitt, 35 years old. She tweeted about Pizzagate. She tweeted thousands of tweets to Fox News hosts. She engaged [on] social media with the conspiracy news Internet site Info Wars. In 2020, she began to tweet with QAnon accounts and use QAnon hashtags. Oh, see, not a pro-democracy demonstrator, not an unarmed military veteran. So she sent tweets to Fox News hosts. No problem. Ashli Babbitt got what she deserved. What’s amazing is not simply the grotesque cruelty of assessments like that — a young women is shot to death and the media applaud — but what’s more amazing is the contrast between this and the coverage of other violence that’s now in progress. Tuesday night, Biden voters burned a police building in Portland, Oregon. Did you know that? Probably not, it didn’t get much coverage. In the wake of Daunte Wright’s death Sunday, riots broke out all over the country, in New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, and Minneapolis. TERRELL RIPS MINNESOTA MAYOR'S REMARK ABOUT COPS NOT NEEDING GUNS AT TRAFFIC STOPS<br><br>People were stealing stuff off store shelves, but don’t call it looting. It’s a peaceful demonstration. We know that because the mayor of Brooklyn Center, Mike Elliott, told us so. Tuesday night, Mayor Elliott tweeted a picture of himself on the scene. ""Earlier this evening, I had the opportunity to go talk to these peaceful protesters,"" he wrote. ""Our city is calm now."" Here’s the funny thing: the mayor’s wearing a Kevlar helmet in the picture, which was not taken in Syria, but in his own town. That’s how peaceful it is. He was wearing a Kevlar helmet. Whatever else he is, Mike Elliott isn’t a very effective liar. Others, by contrast, have decided to drop the pretense entirely. BLM leader Bree Newsome no longer talks about ""peaceful protests."" She doesn’t want those any more. ""I’m definitely in the camp of defending rioting and looting as a legitimate, politically-informed response to state violence,"" she wrote in a tweet that the Twitter censors have pointedly left up. It goes without saying that Bree Neswsome is a child of privilege. Only privileged people could be that decadent. What’s really striking is that Newsome once committed a more aggressive version of the offense that Samuel Montoya is changed with. A few years ago, she trespassed at the Capitol in South Carolina and ripped down the flag. She also trespassed in a state lawmaker’s office and refused to leave. Is she rotting in jail? No. She was arrested briefly, then drew praise from no less than Hillary Clinton herself. Hillary endorsed that particular insurrection. But not everyone gets the same treatment, you may have noticed. That should worry you, no matter who you voted for and no matter how fervently you may support Joe Biden. This is a huge, society-ending problem. Laws have no meaning if they’re not applied equally. When they are not applied equally, they are not even laws. They’re just tools of political persecution. You don’t want to live in a country like that, even if the people you don’t like are the ones being persecuted. Rashida Tlaib does want to live like that. Tlaib is a member of Congress, so her security is never in doubt. She’s protected by bodyguards, weapons of war, and now thousands of federal troops you’re paying for. She’s fine. But in your neighborhood, she’d like to see the police eliminated. AOC SAYS DAUNTE WRIGHT DEATH NO 'ACCIDENT,' INSTEAD PART OF 'INDEFENSIBLE SYSTEM'<br><br>""No more policing, incarceration, and militarization,"" Tlaib wrote on Twitter this week. ""It can't be reformed."" Again, militarization is fine if the military is protecting her. She’s got federal troops. But not for you. You get mob rule. We’re not making this up, we’re not misquoting her. She’s demanding this in public as a member of Congress. Many are. A character on MSNBC tells us that we must abolish your police department immediately:<br><br>JASON JOHNSON: I’ve been saying we need to abolish American policing as it currently exists. It doesn’t work ... Do you know the average [number of] homicides that are actually solved by police departments? Only about 35%. You know the number of rapes and sexual assaults that are solved by police departments? Less than 60%. You know the percentage, likelihood of being shot unarmed as a Black person is, like, five times as likely than a White person? Policing doesn’t work the way we’re doing it right now. A panel of privileged people tell you to abolish the police. But they’re not saying actually abolish the police. We often claim they are, but listen very carefully. They say they want to abolish American policing as it currently exists. And that raises the question: how does policing currently exist? Here’s how: local communities get to control it. So the cops walking down your street, you hired them. That’s what Rashida Tlaib doesn’t like. That’s what offends MSNBC. The thing they hate about it is that they don’t control it. They can’t use your local police department to punish you for your political views. For that, they have to go to the FBI. It drives them crazy. CORI BUSH CLAIMS COP 'WOULD'VE KNOWN THE DIFFERENCE' BETWEEN GUN, TASER IF DAUNTE WRIGHT 'WASN'T A BLACK BOY'<br><br>Abolishing the police doesn’t mean getting rid of people with guns. It merely and specifically means stripping you of any control over local law enforcement. It’s just a more ambitious form of gun control, meant to disempower the citizenry, not protect them. When your police department answers to them, things will be very different. To get a sense of how different, take a look at what the Biden administration is doing in the state of Oregon. In the past few days, federal prosecutors have essentially dropped half a dozen federal felony cases that arose from those famous riots in Portland last summer. The feds reached non-prosecution agreements, which ensure that people who committed felonies will walk away with no criminal record of any kind. What are the defendants in Oregon accused of doing? More than trespassing. One of them, a woman called Alexandra Eutin, was charged with beating a Portland police officer in the head with a wooden shield while he was trying to make an arrest. Another defendant, called Alexa Daron Graham, was charged with trying to bring down a police aircraft with a laser pointer. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP<br><br>Now that’s bad, obviously. But it’s not quite as bad as, say, voting for Donald Trump, or walking around the Capitol building with a camera. Alexandra Eutin and Alexa Graham won't have a criminal record by the end of this. Samuel Montoya could spend the next seven years in jail. You see what’s going on. Two systems of justice -- one for the allies of the people in charge, and a very different one for their enemies. These aren’t traditional liberals. They’re not calling for a peaceful utopia where no one uses violence. This isn’t the tradition of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King. That was the old liberalism. We used to make fun of it, when it was going on. We could use a lot more of it now. This stuff is scary.

24,46,18,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/americas-failure-to-protect-its-children-from-school-shootings-is-a-national-disgrace-parkland-florida,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/us/politics/biden-trump-philadelphia-pennsylvania.html,https://www.salon.com/2020/05/28/yes-trumps-twitter-threats-against-democrats-are-a-distraction--but-we-cant-ignore-them,"Early on Wednesday afternoon, Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, in Parkland, Florida, had a fire drill, an eleventh-grader named Gabriella Figueroa told MSNBC’s Brian Williams. “Then we heard gunshots,” Figueroa said. “Then it went to code red. And then it was crazy.”<br><br>An individual with deadly intent was in the school building, holding an assault weapon that was designed for fighting wars. As Figueroa’s use of the term “code red” indicated, such an event is no longer considered an aberration. All across the country, school boards drill their teachers and students in how to respond to such an emergency. Code yellow: turn cell phones to silent, return to the classroom, and follow the teacher’s instructions. Code red: find a secure area immediately, lock the door, close the blinds, turn off the lights, do not move. This lockdown wasn’t a drill, of course. By the time it was over, seventeen people had been shot dead, and more than a dozen had been wounded. “Bodies were lying in the hallway,” another eyewitness told Fox News. “People were killed in the hallway.” Police later identified the suspected killer as Nikolas Cruz, a nineteen-year-old former student who had been expelled for discipline problems. After Cruz fled the scene—he was arrested shortly after the shooting, in neighboring Coral Springs—news helicopters captured footage of students walking and running from the school, some of them carrying flowers and cards. It was Valentine’s Day, after all. By that point, the authorities had secured the area around the school. There were heavily armed cops, police cars, bomb-squad trucks, and F.B.I. vehicles. The mayor of Parkland, a former teacher named Beam Furr, told CNN, “It’s all being fairly well coördinated, and everyone is doing everything they can.”<br><br>But were they? On Twitter, President Donald Trump offered his “prayers and condolences to the families of the victims,” adding that “no child, teacher, or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.” Fox News interviewed Marco Rubio, Florida’s junior senator, who has an A-plus rating from the National Rifle Association. “I hope people reserve judgment.... The facts of this are important,” Rubio said. As soon as the facts are clear, Rubio went on, “we can have a deeper conversation about why these things happen.” The forty-six-year-old Republican added, “It’s a terrible situation. It’s amazing the amount of carnage that one individual can carry out in such a short period of time.”<br><br>Yet some pertinent facts are already known. According to local police, Cruz was armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle—the same type of gun that Adam Lanza used to kill twenty-six pupils and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School, in December, 2012. Evidently, Rubio still isn’t aware of the power of such weapons, which fire bullets that can penetrate a steel helmet from a distance of five hundred yards. When fired from close range at civilians who aren’t wearing body armor, the bullets from an AR-15 don’t merely penetrate the human body—they tear it apart. It “looks like a grenade went off in there,” Peter Rhee, a trauma surgeon at the University of Arizona, told Wired. To spare the families of the victims—and the public at large—additional anguish, these sorts of details are often glossed over in the aftermath of mass shootings. But it’s surely long past time that we acknowledged these facts, and that we begin to more fully discuss the complicity of N.R.A.-backed politicians like Rubio, and Florida’s governor, Rick Scott, in maintaining the environment that allows these tragedies to happen again and again and again. One of the first duties of any government is to protect its citizens, through collective action, from violent threats they’d otherwise have to fend off themselves. Even most libertarians accept this principle. But when it comes to mass shootings, the Republican Party falls back on constitutional arguments that have no proper basis in history, and it refuses to budge from this stance. Nothing can shift it—not Sandy Hook, not the Orlando night-club shooting, not the Las Vegas massacre, not weekly shootings in schools. (According to the Guardian, Wednesday’s attack in Parkland was the eighth school shooting this year that has resulted in death or injury.) Nothing. The Democrats aren’t entirely blameless, either. In 2009 and 2010, when they controlled the White House and both houses of Congress, they failed to take some steps that were obviously necessary, such as closing the gun-show loophole for background checks and reinstating the Clinton Administration’s ban on assault weapons, which the Bush Administration allowed to expire. The Republicans bear the primary responsibility, though. Ever since Sandy Hook, it is their craven subservience to the gun lobby that has prevented meaningful action, even as the carnage that Rubio referred to has continued. “Turn on your televisions right now and you are going to see scenes of children running for their lives,” Chris Murphy, the junior Democratic senator for Connecticut, said on the Senate floor on Wednesday afternoon. “Let me just note once again for my colleagues: this happens nowhere else other than the United States of America. This epidemic of mass slaughter, this scourge of school shooting after school shooting, it only happens here. Not because of coincidence, not because of bad luck, but as a consequence of our inaction. We are responsible for a level of mass atrocity that happens in this country with zero parallel anywhere else.”<br><br>The key concept in that excellent peroration was responsibility. Even with the blood of defenseless children flowing along the corridors of schoolhouses, the U.S. government has abdicated its duty to protect. And that, it bears repeating ad nauseum, is a national disgrace.","Trump Put Down Philadelphia. The City Got Payback. A city that “will long remember slights,” as one area congressman put it, came through for Joe Biden, who benefited from his ties there and President Trump’s affronts to its voters. Send any friend a story<br><br>As a subscriber, you have 10 gift articles to give each month. Anyone can read what you share. PHILADELPHIA — It was just before noon on Saturday, and Bob Brady was trying to reach Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the phone. Mr. Brady, the chairman of the Philadelphia Democrats, wanted to pass along an increasingly open secret among elections officials and the news media: The city was about to release a tally of roughly 3,000 more votes. The phone was answered by Mr. Biden’s brother James Biden, who relayed Mr. Brady’s bulletin to the candidate sitting next to him. The significance would not have been lost on anyone who had been closely following the ballot-counting process — if the percentages lined up right for Mr. Biden, the votes would put him over the top. And, indeed, just as his brother and Mr. Brady hung up the phone, 2,431 votes from the city moved into Mr. Biden’s column, clinching Pennsylvania’s 20 electoral votes, and with them, the presidency. Philadelphia and its suburban counties had laid the final brick that rebuilt the proverbial blue wall in 2020, and Democrats here wanted to make sure everyone — especially President Trump — knew it. As the newly counted votes set off a rapid-fire succession of news outlets calling the race for Mr. Biden, the city that heralds itself as the birthplace of American independence from Britain celebrated the toppling of a leader who had provoked its anger. In laying the groundwork for his baseless claims of voter fraud, Mr. Trump had declared from the debate stage that “bad things happen in Philadelphia,” and over the weekend his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani assailed a history of corruption in the city as he pursued unlikely efforts to challenge the election results. But ask Philadelphians about when things turned sour with the president, and many will point back more than two years, to his abrupt cancellation of a traditional White House visit for the city’s beloved Eagles football team after its first ever Super Bowl victory in 2018. In this city with a penchant for deeply held civic grudges, trash talk and impolitic celebrations of its rivals’ travails, where Crisco slathered on telephone poles to prevent climbing is a sign of impending revelry, the blocks around City Hall on Saturday began to resemble the famed Super Bowl parade of 2018. Chest-pumping pride spilled out, with expressions of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden, the former vice president, often overshadowed by feelings of vengeance toward Mr. Trump. “Philly knows how to stand up for itself, and love us or hate us, this is what we do right here,” said Rob Cancel, 37, as he joined the celebration outside the city’s convention center on Saturday sporting a red “Bad things happen in Philadelphia” T-shirt. “We come out, we show up and we show them who we are. We’re a strong, strong, proud people.”<br><br>Others were more direct. “I must say, Philly got to tell him he’s fired. Woo!” said Stephanie Marsh, 40, as she skipped down Arch Street toward the convention center. A widely circulated photograph showed one man holding a sign listing perceived civic adversaries — though it used a different, more profane, word — who had been “defeated by Philadelphia,” including King George III, the former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Mr. Trump. Another photo showed a sign held aloft over revelers noting that Mr. Trump had “disinvited the Eagles to the White House.” It added, “So we returned the favor.”<br><br>“Philadelphia is a city that will long remember slights, and the fact the president of the United States personally, repeatedly, went after us is something that we absolutely took offense to and wanted to fight back against,” said Representative Brendan Boyle, who represents Northeast Philadelphia and was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Mr. Biden’s presidential campaign. “Donald Trump was insane to pick on Philadelphia. If there was ever a city that anyone should never mess with, it is Philadelphia.”<br><br>Separate from the enmity for Mr. Trump, Philadelphia has long been a base of support — and cash — for Mr. Biden, who has strong ties to the city, having served for 36 years as a senator from neighboring Delaware, during which time he lived in the suburbs of Wilmington, Del., about 45 minutes from Center City in Philadelphia. He was sometimes referred to as “Pennsylvania’s third senator,” though his affinity for the state stems to no small degree from his upbringing in Scranton, more than two hours north of Philadelphia. His wife, Jill Biden, grew up in Philadelphia’s northern suburbs and has maintained its distinct accent, to the approval of discerning Philadelphia ears. The future first couple root for the city’s sports teams, and were on hand for the most glorious moment in its athletic history — the Eagles’ victory over the heavily favored Patriots at the 2018 Super Bowl in Minneapolis. Two of Mr. Biden’s granddaughters have lived in the city and attended the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia, which was also the alma mater of Mr. Biden’s son Beau, who died in 2015, and the president-elect’s daughter, Ashley, who reportedly still lived in the city as of last month. After Mr. Biden’s vice presidency, the university became a key part of his professional base, establishing the Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement in Washington. He was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars as a professor by the university, and several of his close advisers, including possible appointees in the nascent Biden administration, were affiliated at various times with the center. They include Steve Ricchetti, the Biden campaign’s chairman and the president-elect’s former vice-presidential chief of staff, as well as Brian McKeon, Colin Kahl, Michael Carpenter and Dan Erikson, former advisers to Mr. Biden. When Mr. Biden began his presidential bid, he chose Philadelphia for the campaign’s headquarters, as well as his announcement speech and kickoff fund-raiser, which was held at a home in the city’s leafy West Mount Airy neighborhood belonging to David L. Cohen, a senior executive at Comcast. Mr. Cohen, who is also the chairman of the board of trustees of the University of Pennsylvania, had participated in the ribbon-cutting for the Biden Center. Mr. Biden’s campaign staff had a number of Philadelphia-area natives in prominent roles, including its national political director, Erin Wilson. To increase turnout in the city, Democrats pulled out all of the stops. They called in celebrity reinforcements like Debra Messing and Kathy Najimy and sent them knocking on doors. They lined up John Legend to croon for a packed parking lot. And they dispatched top political surrogates, including former President Barack Obama and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, to campaign in the city. Local Democrats augmented the effort. Representative Dwight Evans organized car caravans to snake through neighborhoods in his district, which includes parts of North Philadelphia and West Philadelphia, honking at residents to remind them to vote. On Sunday, his caravan drove for 35 miles. Philadelphia stretches just 15 miles north to south. “The easy thing about this was, it was not persuasion — you only had to ensure that the process was working,” Mr. Evans said. He added that his own 10th Ward, in the northwest part of the city, had voted for Mr. Biden by 97.5 percent to 2.5 percent over Mr. Trump. “And us doing those car caravans was us explaining that process.”<br><br>Five days before the election, Mr. Biden hopped on a Zoom meeting with Philadelphia Democrats, telling them, “Philadelphia is the place where everything happened for me.” He added: “It’s where I raised my money when I was a senator. It’s where I got support. It’s where I got help.”<br><br>He turned to his friend Bob Brady, the Democratic chairman. “If you’ve got to be in a foxhole, we want you in there with us,” Mr. Biden said. For Mr. Brady, who has led the Democratic Party in this city for 34 years, the effort in Philadelphia was personal. Mr. Brady and Mr. Biden are close, having grabbed countless “steaks on the go” through the years, perfecting the familiar lean of bending at the hips to avoid cheesesteak stains on their clothes. After Mr. Obama asked him to be his running mate in 2008, Mr. Biden called his wife, and his next call went to Mr. Brady. “People were asking how much pressure I had on me because he is my friend,” Mr. Brady said. “A ton of pressure. A ton of pressure.”<br><br>And on the Sunday before Election Day, Mr. Biden spoke to canvassers gathered by Congressman Boyle at the campaign headquarters that he shares with his brother, Kevin J. Boyle, a Pennsylvania state representative, in Northeast Philadelphia. Mr. Biden told the crowd, “We have an expression where I come from: You never forget those who brung you to the dance.”<br><br>He thanked Congressman Boyle, saying that “we owe Brendan” for his endorsement on “the day I announced,” and that “it brought along everything else that’s happened.”<br><br>When the race was called for Mr. Biden, Mr. Boyle, who gave leave to two of his congressional aides to work in the Biden campaign’s political shop, tweeted: “WE DID IT! PHILLY PUTS BIDEN OVER THE TOP IN PENNSYLVANIA!”<br><br>In an interview on Monday, the congressman, who is said to be under consideration for a possible administration post, predicted that a Biden administration would be receptive to the concerns of the Philadelphia area, and not just because of its role in his election. “It helps to have someone in the White House at the top who is very familiar with our area and cares about it,” Mr. Boyle said. Nick Corasaniti reported from Philadelphia, and Kenneth P. Vogel from Washington.","Donald Trump, by design, is a chaos monster who shovels crap out faster than people can process it. Unencumbered by normal human qualities like empathy or conscience, Trump can bounce from one awful behavior from another — grifting, sexual assault and harassment, racism, lying, conspiracy-mongering, criminal schemes — with astonishing speed, doing more wicked deeds in a day that what most aspiring villains can accomplish in a year or even a lifetime. In an effort to get a handle on the endless deluge of awfulness pouring out of Trump, it's become common to describe some of the godawful things he does as ""distractions"" from other awful things he does. It's an effort to triage our response, apparently on the theory that figuring out which Trump evils rank higher than others can somehow sharpen our efforts to process and resist them. It's an honorable desire based in empirical evidence: Indeed, Trump sometimes does or says nasty things to divert public and media attention from other nasty things he does or says. Unfortunately, this often fails to understand that the nasty stuff Trump does to distract us from other nasty stuff is incredibly dangerous on its own terms, and can't just be shrugged off as a pure or content-free distraction. Today's case in point: Trump, who has frequently indulged in late-night binges of Twitter vitriol while most Americans are asleep, was at it again late on Wednesday night when he decided to promote a video by a cowboy cosplayer and Trump superfan named Couy Griffin declaring, ""The only good Democrat is a dead Democrat."" ""Thank you Cowboys. See you in New Mexico!"" Trump said of the video, which echoed a 19th-century slogan — ""the only good Indian is a dead Indian"" — used to justify genocide against Native Americans. So far, however, the mainstream media reaction has been a big, fat shrug. And it's easy to see why. Indeed, it's fair to argue that Trump's trolling antics of late are an attempt to distract attention from the real-world disaster unfolding in this country, largely due to his negligence. The U.S. has officially crossed mark of 100,000 dead from COVID-19. More than 40 million people who have filed for unemployment. Trump has entirely given up on even pretending to have any national strategy for fighting the virus, beyond demanding that states ""reopen"" ASAP to let the virus wash over us and kill untold thousands more. ""This whole thing is a distraction, and you know it,"" Chris Cuomo of CNN said on Wednesday night, adding that Trump stirs the pot with this hateful nonsense to distract ""from the dead and the dire situation that [he's] basically ignoring."" On Thursday morning, MSNBC's Joe Scarborough, who has been fending off Trump's vile and baseless murder accusations in recent weeks, made a similar point. Trump defames him and others, Scarborough said, to distract us from the fact that he ignored or neglected the coronavirus pandemic for months. He would rather have people ""talk about how vile his tweets are or how dangerous his fight with Twitter is"" than about the 100,000 dead. Neither Cuomo nor Scarborough was talking specifically about Trump tweeting out violent rhetoric toward Democrats — Cuomo's segment aired shortly bit before Trump did that — but about the mountainous garbage fire of the president's Twitter feed in general, of which this threatening rhetoric was just a small piece. Trump is absolutely throwing out whatever he can in a desperate bid to regain control of the conversation so that his massive failures aren't the focus. That's led to at least two nights where he stayed up late and sent more than 100 tweets, in hopes of coughing up something outrageous enough to seize the headlines. So it's true that these things are blatant distractions. But it doesn't follow that the best approach is necessarily to ignore Trump's childish behavior. The fact the president of the United States is encouraging domestic terrorism against ""Democrats"" — not just against specific politicians, which would be bad enough, but against anyone who identifies as a Democrat — is not a small thing. On the contrary, it's incredibly dangerous. It wasn't all that long ago, though it may seem like another epoch, when a domestic terrorist apparently set out to murder Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and the staffers at CNN — among others — with mail bombs, because he loved Trump so much. In fact, the president's level of plausible deniability was higher then: That was before Trump had openly called for such violence. Now there's an army of angry reactionaries with guns — whom Trump has eagerly encouraged with his ""LIBERATE"" tweets — who hang on his every word and appear ready to escalate to open armed insurrection. It's undeniable that at least a few people, and perhaps more than that, will interpret this as a push to lash out with targeted violence in the middle of an election year. The only real question is how widespread that violence will be. Let's not fool ourselves here. In the video Trump tweeted, Griffin pivots from his incendiary language to claim that he only wishes Democrats dead ""in a political sense."" This falls somewhere between legalistic ass-covering and standard-issue gaslighting, with Griffin trying to hoodwink people into ignoring what he said just moments before. He's trying to have his right-wing shitposting cake and eat it too, openly encouraging violence while also trying to evade responsibility with digressive, rambling explanations of how you can't believe he really means what he just said. But Griffin means it, and Trump does too. As Will Sommer of The Daily Beast found when he interviewed Griffin, the guy does a piss-poor job at disguising his obvious longing for violent retribution against Democrats, who he believes have no legitimate claim to representation in politics. ""You get to pick your poison: you either go before a firing squad, or you get the end of the rope,"" Griffin said of Democratic governors, right after claiming he wasn't seriously proposing killing anyone. When asked whether anti-lockdown protesters were considering violence, Griffin said, ""There's not an option that's not on the table."" Like Donald Trump, Griffin's an obvious coward who wants to push violent rhetoric but isn't willing to face the consequences for doing so. By pushing Griffin's speech, Trump is engaging in stochastic terrorism, in which a prominent voice puts out the suggestion of radical violence, but refuses to acknowledge any responsibility if and when someone else acts on it. Trump is desperate and clinging to anything he can use, including threats of violence, to scare Democratic voters away from the polls in November. Since the presidential election is our last available mechanism to remove Trump and replace him with someone vaguely sane and competent, this is no small thing. In the age of the coronavirus, in fact, replacing Trump with someone competent is more important than ever. It's quite literally the only hope this country has of saving lives and saving our economy. There's a way to call out Trump's violent trolling while also keeping the focus on the rising numbers of dead and unemployed. It's about going meta — pointing out not just the facts of Trump's behavior, but why he's doing the things he does. That's actually what Cuomo and Scarborough did in their TV segments, ironically enough. Neither man is actually ignoring Trump's Twitter antics. They highlight that stuff while also explaining to viewers the not-so-hidden purpose of such trolling: Trying to divert attention away from the 100,000 dead and 40 million unemployed. Their segments are good examples of how to walk and chew gum at the same time. They're not taking the ""ignore his antics and he'll go away"" approach. Rather, they're doing what all journalists should be doing, which is closer to a both/and approach — calling out Trump's often violent and mendacious distractions while also highlighting the real toll of his leadership failures on the American people. That's what everyone in media should be doing. Ignoring Trump won't make him go away. He is still president, unfortunately. He will always have a direct line to his followers, and now he's using that connection to deliver unsubtle hints that they should use violence to prevent Democrats from voting him out of office. He's also playing the same game with his false accusations against Scarborough, creating a permission structure for some lunatic with a gun who wants to avenge his orange godhead against the ""fake news."" Sadly, men with guns who want to hurt you isn't a problem we can just ignore away. We can focus instead not just on what Trump is doing but why he's doing it. What: Using incendiary rhetoric in hopes of inspire his followers to take violent action on his behalf. Why: Because he's becoming aware that, thanks to his massive failures as president, he probably can't keep power through nonviolent and legal means. Donald Trump's increasingly dangerous flirtation with using mob violence to subvert democracy isn't a small story. It must be covered, but covered carefully — and always by pointing toward the dark goals he hopes to accomplish with this vile behavior.",2.4699999999999998,2.5,2.0,1.53,1.5,1.0,0.7349999999999999,0.75,1.0,0.047238749999999996,0.046875,0.05555555555555555

Identifying the source of that September 2016 article on Trump campaign volunteer Carter Page has taken on added importance in recent weeks. First, Rep. Devin Nunes, California Republican and chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, issued a declassified memo on Feb. 2. It said the FBI relied greatly on Mr. Steele’s discredited Democrat-financed dossier to obtain a surveillance warrant on Mr. Page. To bolster the dossier’s charge that Mr. Page met with two Kremlin figures in Moscow, the FBI cited the Yahoo News article, which said the same thing. But the Nunes memo said the FBI, in its Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act application, wasn’t corroborating the dossier because the Page accusation in Yahoo came from the same source: Mr. Steele. “The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23, 2016 Yahoo News article by Michael Isikoff, which focuses on Page’s July 2016 trip to Moscow,” the memo states. “This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.”<br><br>Mr. Nunes cited Mr. Steele’s testimony, through his attorneys, in a London court case in which he is being sued for libel. Then came a Democratic rebuttal from Rep. Adam B. Schiff of California, a leading dossier supporter. Mr. Schiff, the House intelligence committee’s top Democrat, said Republicans failed to “cite evidence that Steele disclosed to Yahoo details included in the FISA warrant, since the British Court filings to which they refer do not address what Steele may have said to Yahoo.”<br><br>This assertion is important to Democrats. They are trying to bolster the FBI as it pursues collusion charges between the Trump campaign and Russia, and also support Mr. Steele, whose unverified accusations they have repeatedly cited. The two pieces of evidence that say Mr. Steele was in fact the source:<br><br>⦁ In the London court case, Mr. Steele acknowledged that he came to the U.S. in September 2016 at the request of Fusion GPS, which paid him with Democratic Party money. He met with a number of major news representatives, including The New York Times and The Washington Post as he tried to sell his explosive charges. Included in Mr. Steele’s list of appointments was a meeting with Mr. Isikoff. Mr. Isikoff subsequently wrote a story that matched the dossier. Both the dossier and the Yahoo story said Mr. Page met with two U.S.-sanctioned Russians, Rosneft oil chief Igor Sechin and Vladimir Putin aide Igor Diveykin. Mr. Isikoff sourced the information not to Mr. Steele but to a “Western intelligence source.”<br><br>Mr. Page, whose trip to Moscow was for a public speech at a university, has repeatedly denied under oath that he met the two men. The former Moscow resident and energy investor has decried the investigation into him, including the nearly one-year-long wiretap, which he says found no wrongdoing. ⦁ After Mr. Schiff wrote his rebuttal to the Nunes memo on Jan. 31, Mr. Isikoff, a longtime journalist in Washington with a number of scoops to his credit, posted an edition of his podcast, “Skullduggery,” on Feb. 2. Through the Nunes memo, Mr. Isikoff had just learned and said he was surprised that the FBI relied on his article before the FISA court judge. He told about being summoned by his “old friend,” Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, to a private room in a Washington hotel to meet the former spy from Britain. “Steele tells me an amazing story,” Mr. Isikoff said. “One of Donald Trump’s foreign policy advisers, Carter Page, had flown to Moscow and held private talks with close associates of Vladimir Putin about lifting U.S. sanctions against Russia. And Steele tells me something else that day that gets my attention. He has taken this information to the FBI, and the bureau is very interested. Why were they interested? What did the bureau know that would prompt them to take the next step of launching an investigation into an adviser to the Republican nominee for president?”<br><br>Mr. Isikoff subsequently wrote the article that ended up in the FBI’s FISA petition. His podcast sealed the case for Mr. Nunes. This prompts the question: Why did the FBI believe that the dossier section about Mr. Page and the Isikoff article came from collaborating sources? The answer lies in a declassified referral sent to the Justice Department from Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican, and Sen. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina Republican. The two said the evidence suggests that Mr. Steele lied to the FBI when he denied being the source. They have asked the Justice Department to investigate him. “The FBI repeatedly represented to the court that Mr. Steele told the FBI he did not have unauthorized contacts with the press about the dossier prior to October 2016,” the senators’ referral said. “The FISA applications make these claims specifically in the context of the September 2106 Yahoo News article. But Mr. Steele has admitted — publicly before a court of law — that he did have such contacts with the press at this time and his former business partner Mr. Simpson has confirmed it to the committee.”<br><br>The referral says that the FBI either submitted false information or “Mr. Steele made materially false statements to the FBI when he claimed he provided the dossier information only to his business partner and the FBI.”","Pelosi announces House won't vote now on whether to begin impeachment inquiry<br><br>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced after meeting with the House Democratic caucus on Tuesday that there will be no vote -- at least for now -- on the launch of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump. ""There's no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,"" Pelosi said. ""We're not here to call bluffs -- we're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious."" The move was seemingly a boon for moderate Democrats in swing districts, who have been reluctant to have a formal vote in favor of the proceedings as the 2020 elections approach -- even as several of them have also sought to appease liberal constituents by vocally backing the ongoing inquiry. A congressional aide familiar with House Democrats' discussions told Fox News that many House Democrats did not want to be seen as letting the White House dictate how the House conducted itself. Last week, the White House sent a fiery letter to House Democrats announcing that it would not cooperate with their inquiry, for several reasons -- including that, contrary to past precedent, no formal vote had been held on whether to begin impeachment proceedings. Pelosi ripped those arguments: ""They have no substance. They can't defend the president, so they're going to process,"" she said. In a head-turning moment, Pelosi told reporters, ""All roads seem to lead to Putin with the president"" -- even though Democrats began their probe because of the president's actions concerning Ukraine, not Russia. GIULIANI WON'T COMPLY WITH DEMS' SUBPOENA IN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY<br><br>Pelosi last month unilaterally held a news conference announcing that impeachment proceedings were in progress. House rules do not require a vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, but it remains unclear whether the courts will agree that an impeachment inquiry has begun without such a vote. If courts do not find that a formal inquiry is in progress, they could curtail Democrats' evidence-gathering efforts. However, the House speaker heralded a series of recent court victories by Democrats, including a key win in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that reaffirmed congressional authority to subpoena several years of Trump's financial records from his accounting firm, Mazars. ""The rulings that we won last week -- three of them were against the president's hateful public charge rule from taking effect,"" Pelosi said, referring to the administration's immigration policy. ""A ruling against the president's sham national emergency declaration to build his wasteful border wall. A ruling in the Mazars case led by [House Oversight Committee] Chairman [Elijah] Cummings. ... so again, five victories on Friday, one today, in terms of Emoluments."" Separately at the press conference on Tuesday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accused the White House of ""stonewalling"" despite those rulings. ""Were it not for the fact that at least some witnesses have given us documents, we would not know there is a paper record of efforts to condition this meeting, and perhaps condition military support itself, on these political investigations Donald Trump wanted,"" Schiff said, referring to Trump's fateful July call with Ukraine's leader. ""Those documents would have been completely bottled up by the State Department. ... The evidence of obstruction of Congress continues to mount."" Schiff said the Office of Management and Budget has refused to provide evidence concerning whether the Trump administration withheld aid to Ukraine, contingent on the country conducting an investigation of Joe and Hunter Biden's business dealings there. ""The Constitution is clear. ... the House will have the sole power of impeachment,"" Schiff said later, when asked why there would be no floor vote on an impeachment inquiry. WHITE HOUSE UNLOADS ON DEMS, EXPLAINS WHY IT WON'T COOPERATE WITH 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT PROBE<br><br>The White House has strongly suggested it will take the fight over the Democrats' subpoenas to the Supreme Court. ""In the history of our nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the president without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step,"" the White House letter to Pelosi and other top Democratic leaders stated. It continued: ""Without waiting to see what was actually said on the call, a press conference was held announcing an 'impeachment inquiry' based on falsehoods and misinformation about the call."" Despite Pelosi's claim that there was no “House precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,” several previous impeachment inquiries have been launched only by a full vote of the House -- including the impeachment proceedings concerning former Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton. White House officials told Fox News the vote opening the proceedings was a small ask, considering the implications of potentially overturning a national election. Responding to the letter, Pelosi accused Trump of ""trying to make lawlessness a virtue"" and added, ""The American people have already heard the President’s own words – ‘do us a favor, though.’"" (That line, from a transcript of Trump's call with Ukraine's leader, in reality referred to Trump's request for Ukraine to assist in an investigation into 2016 election interference, and did not relate to Biden.) Pelosi continued: ""This letter is manifestly wrong, and is simply another unlawful attempt to hide the facts of the Trump Administration’s brazen efforts to pressure foreign powers to intervene in the 2020 elections. ... The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the President’s abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction. Mr. President, you are not above the law. You will be held accountable.”<br><br>Just before Pelosi took the microphone on Tuesday, a spokesperson for House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's office emphasized some of the White House's other objections to Democrats' inquiry. THE LATEST REPORTING FROM FOX NEWS IN THE TRUMP IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY AND UKRAINE CONTROVERSY<br><br>Separately, the letter asserted multiple alleged violations of the president's due-process rights. It noted that under current impeachment inquiry proceedings, Democrats were not allowing presidential or State Department counsel to be present. Among the GOP's complaints are that Democrats' procedures did not provide for the ""disclosure of all evidence favorable to the president and all evidence bearing on the credibility of witnesses called to testify in the inquiry,"" according to the White House. And ""the right to see all evidence, to present evidence, to call witnesses, to have counsel present at all hearings, to cross-examine all witnesses, to make objections relating to the examination of witnesses or the admissibility of testimony and evidence, and to respond to evidence and testimony"" has also been obstructed. The White House asserted that Democrats also have not permitted Republicans in the minority to issue subpoenas, contradicting the ""standard, bipartisan practice in all recent resolutions authorizing presidential impeachment inquiries."" Fox News' Chad Pergram and Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.","Once again Judicial Watch is doing the heavy lifting.

The version below appears in the October 23, 2017, issue. 1. Since the establishment of the first studios, a century ago, there have been few movie executives as dominant, or as domineering, as Harvey Weinstein. He co-founded the production-and-distribution companies Miramax and the Weinstein Company, helping to reinvent the model for independent films with movies including “Sex, Lies, and Videotape,” “The Crying Game,” “Pulp Fiction,” “The English Patient,” “Shakespeare in Love,” and “The King’s Speech.” Beyond Hollywood, he has exercised his influence as a prolific fund-raiser for Democratic Party candidates, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Weinstein combined a keen eye for promising scripts, directors, and actors with a bullying, even threatening, style of doing business, inspiring both fear and gratitude. His movies have earned more than three hundred Oscar nominations, and, at the annual awards ceremonies, he has been thanked more than almost anyone else in movie history, ranking just after Steven Spielberg and right before God. For more than twenty years, Weinstein, who is now sixty-five, has also been trailed by rumors of sexual harassment and assault. His behavior has been an open secret to many in Hollywood and beyond, but previous attempts by many publications, including The New Yorker, to investigate and publish the story over the years fell short of the demands of journalistic evidence. Too few people were willing to speak, much less allow a reporter to use their names, and Weinstein and his associates used nondisclosure agreements, payoffs, and legal threats to suppress their accounts. Asia Argento, an Italian film actress and director, said that she did not speak out until now—Weinstein, she told me, forcibly performed oral sex on her—because she feared that Weinstein would “crush” her. “I know he has crushed a lot of people before,” Argento said. “That’s why this story—in my case, it’s twenty years old, some of them are older—has never come out.”<br><br>On October 5th, the New York Times, in a powerful report by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, revealed multiple allegations of sexual harassment against Weinstein, an article that led to the resignation of four members of the Weinstein Company’s all-male board, and to Weinstein’s firing. The story, however, is complex, and there is more to know and to understand. In the course of a ten-month investigation, I was told by thirteen women that, between the nineteen-nineties and 2015, Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them. Their allegations corroborate and overlap with the Times’s revelations, and also include far more serious claims. Three of the women—among them Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Evans—told me that Weinstein had raped them, forcibly performing or receiving oral sex or forcing vaginal sex. Four women said that they had experienced unwanted touching that could be classified as an assault. In an audio recording captured during a New York Police Department sting operation in 2015, Weinstein admits to groping a Filipina-Italian model named Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, describing it as behavior he is “used to.” Four of the women I interviewed cited encounters in which Weinstein exposed himself or masturbated in front of them. Sixteen former and current executives and assistants at Weinstein’s companies told me that they witnessed or had knowledge of unwanted sexual advances and touching at events associated with Weinstein’s films and in the workplace. They and others described a pattern of professional meetings that were little more than thin pretexts for sexual advances on young actresses and models. All sixteen said that the behavior was widely known within both Miramax and the Weinstein Company. Messages sent by Irwin Reiter, a senior company executive, to Emily Nestor, one of the women who alleged that she was harassed, described the “mistreatment of women” as a serial problem that the Weinstein Company had been struggling with in recent years. Other employees described what was, in essence, a culture of complicity at Weinstein’s places of business, with numerous people throughout his companies fully aware of his behavior but either abetting it or looking the other way. Some employees said that they were enlisted in a subterfuge to make the victims feel safe. A female executive with the company described how Weinstein’s assistants and others served as a “honeypot”—they would initially join a meeting along with a woman Weinstein was interested in, but then Weinstein would dismiss them, leaving him alone with the woman. (On October 10th, the Weinstein Company’s board issued a statement, writing that “these allegations come as an utter surprise to the Board. Any suggestion that the Board had knowledge of this conduct is false.”)<br><br>Virtually all of the people I spoke with told me that they were frightened of retaliation. “If Harvey were to discover my identity, I’m worried that he could ruin my life,” one former employee told me. Many said that they had seen Weinstein’s associates confront and intimidate those who crossed him, and feared that they would be similarly targeted. Four actresses, including Mira Sorvino and Rosanna Arquette, told me they suspected that, after they rejected Weinstein’s advances or complained about them to company representatives, Weinstein had them removed from projects or dissuaded people from hiring them. Multiple sources said that Weinstein frequently bragged about planting items in media outlets about those who spoke against him; these sources feared similar retribution. Several pointed to Gutierrez’s case: after she went to the police, negative items discussing her sexual history and impugning her credibility began rapidly appearing in New York gossip pages. (In the taped conversation, part of which The New Yorker posted online, Weinstein asks Gutierrez to join him for “five minutes,” and warns, “Don’t ruin your friendship with me for five minutes.”)<br><br>Several former employees told me that they were speaking about Weinstein’s alleged behavior now because they hoped to protect women in the future. “This wasn’t a one-off. This wasn’t a period of time,” an executive who worked for Weinstein for many years told me. “This was ongoing predatory behavior toward women—whether they consented or not.”<br><br>It’s likely that the women who spoke to me have recently felt increasingly emboldened to talk about their experiences because of the way the world has changed regarding issues of sex and power. Their disclosures follow in the wake of stories alleging sexual misconduct by public figures, including Donald Trump, Bill O’Reilly, Roger Ailes, and Bill Cosby. In October, 2016, a month before the election, a tape emerged of Trump telling a celebrity-news reporter, “And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. . . . Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” This past April, O’Reilly, a host at Fox News, was forced to resign after Fox was discovered to have paid five women millions of dollars in exchange for silence about their accusations of sexual harassment. Ailes, the former head of Fox News, resigned in July, 2016, after he was accused of sexual harassment. Cosby went on trial this summer, charged with drugging and sexually assaulting a woman. The trial ended with a hung jury. In the Times piece, Weinstein made an initial effort at damage control by partly acknowledging what he had done, saying, “I appreciate the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past has caused a lot of pain, and I sincerely apologize for it.” In an interview with the New York Post, he said, “I’ve got to deal with my personality, I’ve got to work on my temper, I have got to dig deep. I know a lot of people would like me to go into a facility, and I may well just do that—I will go anywhere I can learn more about myself.” He went on, “In the past I used to compliment people, and some took it as me being sexual, I won’t do that again.” In his written statement to the Times, Weinstein claimed that he would “channel that anger” into a fight against the leadership of the National Rifle Association. He also said that it was not “coincidental” that he was organizing a foundation for women directors at the University of Southern California. “It will be named after my mom and I won’t disappoint her.” (U.S.C. has since rejected his funding pledge.)","Once again Judicial Watch is doing the heavy lifting.

We have yet to receive a response.","Parkland, Florida, President Donald Trump said in a brief address on Thursday, is “a great and safe community.” The day before, though, a nineteen-year-old carrying an AR-15-style assault weapon that he had purchased legally allegedly walked into the local high school, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, and killed seventeen people. The accused shooter, Nikolas Cruz, is now in custody. Trump, in his address, said that “no child, no teacher, should ever be in danger in an American school.” And yet, apart from a vague offer to share Parkland’s “burden,” he mentioned only one policy response: to “tackle the difficult issue of mental health.” Beyond that, he said, people should answer “cruelty with kindness,” seeking the kind of human connection that “turns classmates and colleagues into friends and neighbors.”<br><br>What does it mean to be a friend and neighbor, though, in a country thick with guns? In tweets posted earlier on Thursday, Trump had—this is not a surprise—taken a different tone, one that seemed less to sympathize with the people of Parkland than to blame them, including the children. “So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!” Does the President believe that high-school students who had to huddle in closets, holding on to one another, before a SWAT team rescued them, are somehow to blame for not having done enough to raise the alarm? As it happens, many of them seem to have alerted authorities, one way or the other; Cruz had been transferred from the school. Teachers had been warned to be alert if he appeared. His own mother, who had adopted him when he was an infant, reportedly, had sought help. (She died late last year; the family of a friend took him in and, according to the Sun-Sentinel, members of that family say, through representatives, that they saw no warning signs, apart from a moodiness and depression that they attributed to the loss of a parent. That picture may be clarified in the days to come.) There were two reports to the F.B.I. about YouTube posts from an account that bore the name “Nikolas Cruz,” referring to a desire to be a “professional school shooter.” (At a press conference on Thursday morning, the F.B.I. said that it hadn’t been able to run those tips down.) When Trump said that concerns needed to be reported “again and again,” he may, without meaning to, have echoed their frustration. The thing that happens again and again—and again, and again, and again; at least eight times this year so far—is school shootings. And night-club shootings, and concert shootings. More and more often, the weapon is an AR-15, or something like it. Also on Thursday morning, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, “It cannot be denied that something dangerous and unhealthy is happening in our country.” But crime has, generally, been falling in the United States over the past decade and a half. One thing that has happened, in terms of mass shootings, is the expiration, during the George W. Bush Administration, of the ban on assault weapons. The Republicans, and many Democrats, have blocked almost every attempt to even moderately change gun laws. As Senator Chris Murphy, of Connecticut—the site of the Sandy Hook shooting—put it, this goes beyond indifference to the realm of “complicity.” And too many Republican politicians, including the President, have, distinctly, encouraged the idea that gun control is part of some federally based plot to take control of America away from “real” Americans. One result is that American children drill—again and again—for mass shootings. Anyone with a child might be in the position of hearing awful, alarming reports on the news, and then rushing to text sons or daughters, wondering if even that is safe, or if the sound of the alert might reveal their child’s hiding place to a shooter. As my colleague John Cassidy notes, students around the country have been trained to turn their phones to silent at the start of a drill. They have been told what to imagine. Do they also have to take on the role of policing teen-agers who may live in houses with multiple, legal weapons? How can they tell the difference between the pathology of their parents, who have done nothing to make the gun laws in this country more sensible, and that of their peers? According to the Sun-Sentinel, the family that took Cruz in knew that he owned a gun—again, legally—and just asked him to keep it locked in a cabinet. “It was his gun,” a lawyer for the family said—and that phrase explains as much about this country as about this crime. Children often need help, and they also must be able to get it. Mental health is a major problem—under-recognized, under-addressed, under-resourced. One might wonder why the Republican Party only seems to notice that when there is a chance that access to guns might be reduced—not when access to health insurance, of the sort that includes mental-health coverage, might be increased. (As Adam Gopnik writes, there are mentally ill people everywhere, but only so many shootings of this kind here.) But the cynicism is even greater than that. Paul Ryan, the Speaker of the House, also speaking on Thursday, echoed Trump in portraying Parkland as a mental-health issue. Last February, as Vox notes, the House, with Republican support, passed a bill overturning an Obama Administration rule that prevented certain people with mental illnesses (those deemed so mentally disabled that they couldn’t manage their own Social Security benefits) from purchasing guns. Trump signed it. The narrowness of that Obama-era restriction opens up the question of what “mentally ill” means in this context, beyond being a way for gun advocates to change the subject. On Thursday morning, the Broward County sheriff, Scott Israel, spoke movingly about the victims, including a football coach he had worked with, Aaron Feis, who died protecting students. The sheriff encouraged the public to help forestall such crimes, giving the example of noticing that a neighbor who, on Fridays, usually arrived home with a shopping bag with “milk and eggs sticking out” was instead carrying a bag of bullets; that would be something to report, he said. The police, he thought, should have more power to pull people in when they sensed that something was off, in order to assess people for mental-health issues. He also listed a fascination with guns as a sign that someone might be a candidate for such involuntary confinement. That fascination can be found at gun shows that hand AR-15s over with no background checks—they’re a legal product, advertised and lovingly marketed and displayed—and at conventions attended by politicians of both parties who take money from the National Rifle Association. The proffering of mental illness as the answer to our shooting problem seems opportunistic, to say the least. It might necessitate a criminalization of adolescent pain, since the level of legal procedure necessary to make someone ineligible to buy a gun would, presumably, be higher than what would be needed to guide a teen-ager to a therapist. (In Florida, the legal standard for blocking gun purchases is that someone has actually been committed to a mental institution or been “adjudicated mentally defective.”) The greater madness is in our gun laws, not in our children.","When 22 people were killed in El Paso, Texas, and nine more were killed in Dayton, Ohio, roughly 12 hours later, responses to the tragedy included many of the same myths and stereotypes Americans have grown used to hearing in the wake of a mass shooting. As part of my work as a psychology researcher, I study mass homicides, as well as society’s reaction to them. A lot of bad information can follow in the wake of such emotional events; clear, data-based discussions of mass homicides can get lost among political narratives. I’d like to clear up four common misconceptions about mass homicides and who commits them, based on the current state of research. Violent Video Games Cause Mass Homicides? By Monday morning after these latest shootings, President Donald Trump along with other Republican politicians had linked violent video games to mass shootings. I’ll admit my surprise, since only last year the Trump administration convened a School Safety Commission which studied this issue, among many others. I myself testified, and the commission ultimately did not conclude there was sufficient evidence to link games and media to criminal violence. Politicians should stop linking violent games to mass shootings. It’s time to lay this myth to rest. Long-term studies of youth consistently find that violent games are not a risk factor for youth violence anywhere from one to eight years later. And no less than the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 2011 that scientific studies had failed to link violent games to serious aggression in kids. A 2017 public policy statement by the American Psychological Association’s media psychology and technology division specifically recommended politicians should stop linking violent games to mass shootings. It’s time to lay this myth to rest. Mass Shooters Are Male White Supremacists? Early reports suggest that the El Paso shooter was a white racist concerned about Latino immigration. Other shooters, such as the perpetrator of the Christchurch, New Zealand, attack, have also been white supremacists. Overall, though, the ethnic composition of the group of all mass shooters in the U.S. is roughly equivalent to the American population. Hateful people tend to be attracted to hateful ideologies. Some shootings, such as the 2016 shooting of police officers in Dallas, were reportedly motivated by anti-white hatred. Other shooters, such as the 2015 San Bernardino husband and wife perpetrator team, have espoused other hateful ideas such as radical Islam. Most mass homicide perpetrators don’t proclaim any allegiance to a particular ideology at all. Of course, mass homicides in other nations—such as several deadly knife attacks in Japan—don’t involve U.S. race issues. As far as gender, it’s true that most mass homicide perpetrators are male. A minority of shooters are female, and they may target their own families. Mental Illness Definitely Is or Is Not to Blame? Whether mental illness is or is not related to mass shootings—or criminal violence more broadly—is a nuanced question. Frankly, proponents on both sides often get this wrong by portraying the issue as clear-cut. As far back as 2002, a U.S. Secret Service report based on case studies and interviews with surviving shooters identified mental illness—typically either psychosis or suicidal depression—as very common among mass homicide perpetrators. As for violence more broadly, mental illness, such as psychosis as well as a mixture of depression with antisocial traits, is a risk factor for violent behavior. Focusing only on mental health is unlikely to put much of a dent in societal violence. Some people suggest mental illness is completely unrelated to crime, but that claim tends to rely on mangled statistics. For instance, I’ve seen the suggestion that individuals with mental illness account for just five percent of violent crimes. However, that assertion is based on research like one Swedish study that limited mental illness to psychosis only, which is experienced by about one percent or less of the population. If one percent of people commit five percent of crimes, that suggests psychosis elevates the risk of crime. It’s also important to point out that the vast majority of people with mental illness do not commit violent crimes. For instance, in one study, about 15 percent of people with schizophrenia had committed violent crimes, as compared to 4 percent of a group of people without schizophrenia. Although this clearly identifies the increase in risk, it also highlights that the majority of people with schizophrenia had not committed violent crimes. It’s important not to stigmatize the mentally ill, which may reduce their incentive to seek treatment. So improving access to mental health services would benefit a whole range of people and, by coincidence, occasionally bring treatment to someone at risk of committing violence. But focusing only on mental health is unlikely to put much of a dent in societal violence. Mass Homicides Are Becoming More Frequent? Mass homicides get a lot of news coverage which keeps our focus on the frequency of their occurrence. Just how frequent is sometimes muddled by shifting definitions of mass homicide, and confusion with other terms such as active shooter. But using standard definitions, most data suggest that the prevalence of mass shootings has stayed fairly consistent over the past few decades. To be sure, the U.S. has experienced many mass homicides. Even stability might be depressing given that rates of other violent crimes have declined precipitously in the U.S. over the past 25 years. Why mass homicides have stayed stagnant while other homicides have plummeted in frequency is a question worth asking. Only through dispassionate consideration of good data will society understand how best to prevent these crimes. Nonetheless, it does not appear that the U.S. is awash in an epidemic of such crimes, at least comparing to previous decades going back to the 1970s. Mass homicides are horrific tragedies and society must do whatever is possible to understand them fully in order to prevent them. But people also need to separate the data from the myths and the social, political and moral narratives that often form around crime. Only through dispassionate consideration of good data will society understand how best to prevent these crimes.
